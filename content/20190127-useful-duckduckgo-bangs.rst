:summary: I switched to DuckDuckGo_ some time ago, and I've not had to look
          back. In this post, I document some of the `"bangs"
          <https://duckduckgo.com/bang>`__ I find useful.

If you haven't moved to DuckDuckGo_ yet, `here's
<https://www.quora.com/Why-should-I-use-DuckDuckGo-instead-of-Google/answer/Gabriel-Weinberg?share=9560e87d&srid=pJKz>`__
why you should consider it. I moved to it a while back, and I've not looked
back since. In this post, I document some of the `"bangs"
<https://duckduckgo.com/bang>`__ that I use which make DuckDuckGo_ even nicer
to use!

A `"bang" <https://duckduckgo.com/bang>`__ is a search shortcut, like ones you
can set up in Firefox and Chrome. Instead of navigating to the website to use
their search box, bangs allow you to search via DuckDuckGo_, and it redirects
you to the search results on the website. So, apart from the obvious privacy
advantage: DuckDuckGo_ uses the website search, not you, it also means you can
search a plethora of websites right from DuckDuckGo_. If you are used to using
the Firefox search bar, for example, this becomes really handy.

General bangs

I use a number of general bangs:

- :code:`!bang` to search for bangs.
- :code:`!w` to search Wikipedia
- :code:`!g` to use Google when I must.
- :code:`!gmaps` to search Google Maps.
- :code:`!openstreetmap` to search Open Street Maps.
- :code:`!youtube` to search Youtube.
- :code:`!bbcw` to search BBC weather.
- :code:`!goodreads` to search Goodreads.
- :code:`!ox` to search the Oxford dictionary.
- :code:`!sauk` to search Amazon UK (smile.amazon.uk).
- :code:`!github` to search Github.
- :code:`!ctan` to search CTAN.
- :code:`!pypi` to search PyPi.
- :code:`!man` to search man pages.

A few academic ones I use often are:

- :code:`!gsc` to search Google Scholar.
- :code:`!arxiv` to search ArXiv.
- :code:`!pubmed` to search PubMed

Fedora related bangs
---------------------

Now, here's where bangs get even more useful! Fedora related bangs!  You can
use :code:`!bang Fedora` to see them all, but I list the ones that are
available now here for you (and me):

- :code:`!fedora` or :code:`!fedorawiki` to search the wiki.
- :code:`!kojipkg` to search Koji for a package.
- :code:`!fedpack` to search the Fedora packages app.
- :code:`!fedoramagazine` to search the Fedora Magazine.
- :code:`!askfedora` to search Ask Fedora.
- :code:`!copr` to search COPR.
- :code:`!rhbugs` or :code:`!rhbz` to search Redhat Bugzilla.

If you do use the quick search boxes that most browsers now provide, this makes
things so much easier. You needn't even use the drop down to select a search.
You just keep using DuckDuckGo_. I use `Qutebrowser
<https://www.qutebrowser.org/>`__ for example, where I use the command window
to do all my navigating. This is how quick it is (Capital O to open a new-tab,
and then :code:`!fedpack nest` to search the Fedora packages application for
NEST, since DuckDuckGo_ is set as my default search service):

So, there are lots of bangs. Use DuckDuckGo_, use bangs, profit! 
Happy ducking!

Addendum
--------

There is, of course, a lmddgtfy service. Try: :code:`!lmddgtfy lmddgtfy`.
DuckDuckGo_ also provides an `App for Android
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android>`__,
and a widget that helps you search without having to open the browser first.

Bangs can be `suggested <https://duckduckgo.com/newbang>`__, so please do
suggest new bangs for other services that you use frequently.
