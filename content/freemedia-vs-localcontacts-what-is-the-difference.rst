In my `recent attempt to revive the LocalContacts program`_, and with
the responses I've received, I've noticed that a lot of people are
unsure of the distinctions between the `free-media`_ and `LocalContact`_
programs. This blog post is an attempt at clarifying the two.

The Fedora free-media Program
-----------------------------

If you `**sign up**`_ to volunteer for this program, you get added to
the "free-media" group in the FAS and have access to the free-media trac.
The trac is the infra that Susmit and the other free-media leads set up
to make it easier for contributors to handle the vast number of tickets
that come in every month.

In the free-media program, when you accept a ticket, you burn the media,
buy the envelop, send it, **all out of your own pocket**.

LocalContacts
-------------

The LocalContacts is also aimed at making fedora media more easily
available to people. There may be people in the same city, or even the
same apartment as an ambassador's (lets call him Angus),  who'd like to
use fedora (lets say  David wants media). It isn't practical for someone
from the other side of the country (lets call him Stephen ) to post
these people media under the free-media program, when the David can meet
Angus and get media burnt. There are quite a few advantages of this
scheme over the free-media program:

-  Promotes interaction between David and Angus. In the free-media
   program, you send media out, and it ends there. You don't meet
   physically, there is no feedback, nothing.
-  More cost effective. It costs Stephen almost 50INR per ticket
   serviced at the free-media program. When the David gets media from
   Angus in person, David incurs the cost of media. Also note that here,
   there is a total of INR $price\_of\_DVD spent in the Local Contacts
   program. In the free-media program, the INR spent would be
   ($price\_of\_DVD + $price\_of\_envelope + $price\_of\_postage).

It was my understanding that a Fedora Ambassador is **by default** a
LocalContact. Therefore, a separate scheme was not required. However,
over the last few weeks, this understanding has changed.
