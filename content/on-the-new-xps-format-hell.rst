Apparently, there's a new document format in the air. It's called "xps".
Frankly, I did not know about this one. Someone I know unknowingly
managed to use it for their travel tickets and I had to do the looking
up to somehow print these documents. OpenOffice does not support the
format. `I found this email thread on why not`_. Anyway, if you really
need to convert a document, there are plenty of sites that let you
convert xps to pdfs (google up!). Personally, I'm going to stay away
from xps.
