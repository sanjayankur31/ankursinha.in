The tour's moving forward. Slowly, but it is moving. We had a quick
meeting last night to divide the first task: Collecting screenshots to
be used in the application. Pahnin laid out the basic steps for us
earlier on the mailing list, and I thought it best to begin work
immediately. Here are the minutes of the meeting:
