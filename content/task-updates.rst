I've been trying to change my workflows/schedules etc. to fit in more
and more work in the 24 hours of the day. I must say, there has been
some improvement. I've also come across posts such as `this`_ one which
are on the same theme. Having said this, here's what I've been upto!

My internship at the `IISc`_ continues. The professor wanted to submit a
paper to one of the conferences, and I was busy all of past week
generating graphs (using `GNUPlot`_) , metrics and the rest. Till now,
all my tasks have been those of a technician. However, since this paper
submission is done, I expect to get some first hand research work.
AWESOME!

My contribution to Fedora continues. (I wouldn't want to give this up,
even if it's just one package review a week!). I have a few packages in
the review queue crawling along. I also submitted a `proposal`_ for the
Fedora GSOC program. Let's hope it gets selected. Fingers crossed!

Other than that, I've been teaching myself more and more C++, and I've
been practicing questions off the `google code jam`_. I've solved quite
a few. I'm trying to keep it to one question a night. There are a few
questions that beat me (obviously!!), but on the whole, I've improved
which makes me happy!

`Rahul`_ from fedora India sent me a 100 DVDs which I could use to send
out free-media. As a result, I've accepted more requests (almost 20),
and I'll try to send them out this week before accepting more. The thing
is, once `F15 releases`_, these F14 media won't be used for free-media
any more, so I am going to finish these off before the F15 release.

I tried out the gnome-shell preview on F14, and really, I like it! I'm
waiting for the F15 beta release on  Tuesday to update my system and
join the Lovelock bandwagon!

Phew, now that you look at it, it seems like quite a bit of work. <pat
on the back!>

All of this was about most of my work, now the fun part. Today's evening
boasts of not one but TWO amazing football matches! The `FA Cup semi
final`_ at Wembley featuring Manchester United and Manchester City is a
must watch! "UNITED!!!!" . If this wasn't enough, the `Spanish La Liga`_
hosts one of the many up coming "El Classico"s tonight when Real Madrid
take on FC Barcelona! What more could a football lover want?

To end my post, I have a 3 day trip to `Pondicherry`_ lined up next
weekend. Good Friday's a holiday, so we're going to try and make most of
the 3 day weekend.

Have fun folks! See you around!
