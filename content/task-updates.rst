I've been trying to change my workflows/schedules etc. to fit in more
and more work in the 24 hours of the day. I must say, there has been
some improvement. I've also come across posts such as `this`_ one which
are on the same theme. Having said this, here's what I've been upto!

My internship at the `IISc`_ continues. The professor wanted to submit a
paper to one of the conferences, and I was busy all of past week
generating graphs (using `GNUPlot`_) , metrics and the rest. Till now,
all my tasks have been those of a technician. However, since this paper
submission is done, I expect to get some first hand research work.
AWESOME!

My contribution to Fedora continues. (I wouldn't want to give this up,
even if it's just one package review a week!). I have a few packages in
the review queue crawling along. I also submitted a `proposal`_ for the
Fedora GSOC program. Let's hope it gets selected. Fingers crossed!

Other than that, I've been teaching myself more and more C++, and I've
been practicing questions off the `google code jam`_. I've solved quite
a few. I'm trying to keep it to one question a night. There are a few
questions that beat me (obviously!!), but on the whole, I've improved
which makes me happy!

`Rahul`_ from fedora India sent me a 100 DVDs which I could use to send
out free media. As a result, I've accepted more requests (almost 20),
and I'll try to send them out this week before accepting more. The thing
is, once `F15 releases`_, these F14 media won't be used for free media
any more, so I am going to finish these off before the F15 release.

I tried out the gnome-shell preview on F14, and really, I like it! I'm
waiting for the F15 beta release on Â Tuesday to update my system and
join the Lovelock bandwagon!

Phew, now that you look at it, it seems like quite a bit of work. <pat
on the back!>

All of this was about most of my work, now the fun part. Today's evening
boasts of not one but TWO amazing football matches! The `FA Cup semi
final`_ at Wembley featuring Manchester United and Manchester City is a
must watch! "UNITED!!!!" . If this wasn't enough, the `Spanish La Liga`_
hosts one of the many up coming "El Classico"s tonight when Real Madrid
take on FC Barcelona! What more could a football lover want?

To end my post, I have a 3 day trip to `Pondicherry`_ lined up next
weekend. Good Friday's a holiday, so we're going to try and make most of
the 3 day weekend.

Have fun folks! See you around!
