I've often been asked,"I'm new to FOSS. How do I begin contributing? I
don't know anything at the moment." I understand the situation that
these noobs are in. After all, we've all been through it. In fact, I'm
still in this position in a lot of scenarios. Well, really, the only
thing to do is to dive in, keep your head down, and WORK.

Having said that, I spotted this email on the devel list a few minutes
back: `Announcing Easyfix`_. Easyfix looks really good, and it presents
novice contributors plenty of opportunities to take up simpler tasks,
and learn in the process. As always, to begin contributing, start with
the `join page on the wiki.`_
