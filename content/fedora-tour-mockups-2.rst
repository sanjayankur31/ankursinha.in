hey,

Been quite a while since we posted about the tour. Here's an update:

Here's the mail I sent to the design list:

    I've made some mockups for the fedora-tour app. we're working on.

    It's really amateur stuff but hopefully enough to get

    the idea across. The real intention is to get you great people to

    criticize them as much as possible ;)

    Please take some time out from your busy schedules and have a look
    :)
