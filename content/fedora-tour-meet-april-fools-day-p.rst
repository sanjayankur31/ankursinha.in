thomasj, subfusc and me met up for a quick meet a few minutes back. It
was just a 45 minute meet. We discussed a new idea to the interface of
the fedora-tour main tour menu, and a couple of other things.

The logs can be found `here`_. Please drop by on #fedora-tour if you
have anything to add. :)

Happy April Fool's day folks!
