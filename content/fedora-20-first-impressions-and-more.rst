I went ahead and updated to Fedora 20 using the Alpha RC3. One reason is
to help test it, provide karma etc., the other is that I simply couldn't
wait to use the new shiny packages!

Installation
------------

I used the Desktop Live media off a USB. The installation went off
without a hitch. It was quick, reused my ``/home`` partition and didn't
crash even once.

Post installation
-----------------

The new Gnome3.9 is pretty good. There are a couple of changes that I'm
still getting used to:

-  The new status menu is slightly buggy, but the issues are all known:
   the network icon tends to disappear.
-  The new status menu doesn't have the "disable notifications" switch
   any more. It's supposed to be moved to the notification settings in
   the left bottom corner of the notifications tray. `It didn't land in
   3.9 though`_
-  Gnome terminal doesn't let me use Alt as Meta in irssi. I'm still
   looking at how to configure this. Any one have any hints?
-  The new dhclient update was buggy, and `my negative karma to the
   update got it unpushed`_ ;)
-  mpd from rpmfusion isn't updated to work with the ffmpeg in F20. It
   `needs to be built from git`_, since the fixes required aren't
   present in the latest 0.7.15 release. I've `built an RPM here`_
   (`SPEC/SRPM here`_) that you can use until it's fixed in rpmfusion.
-  Byobu and gnome terminal both tend to crash randomly sometimes. It's
   something related to mc I think, but I haven't been able to reproduce
   it.

I'm going to keep testing and giving karma to packages. You can do it
too, you can just use a VM instead of an actual install. There is a lot
of work to be done in other areas too. If you have the time, consider
helping out. A good place to start with simple tasks is the `marketing
list`_. Just keep an eye out on the announce list and the planet and
you'll find something or the other to do. ;)

Anyway! Happy testing!
