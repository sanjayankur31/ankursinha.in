:summary: I recently upgraded to `Fedora 25`_ Beta and participated in the `Wayland test day`_!

You must've read somewhere or the other that `Fedora 25`_ Beta was released a few days ago. I went ahead and upgraded both my systems last evening using :code:`dnf system-upgrade`. Complete instructions on how you can upgrade using :code:`dnf` too are on `this wiki page <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DNF_system_upgrade>`__. One's my laptop, and the other is my workstation in the lab at university. Both upgrades went off almost without a hitch. I had a minor issue with a :code:`python-mpd` package that was solved easily enough by removing the package for the upgrade and reinstalling it after. I filed a bug `here <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1383983>`__ anyway. Seems to be a simple packaging fix.

Fedora 25 works quite well. I haven't had any weird issues just yet. My workstation at university has an Intel graphics card (:code:`lspci | grep -i graphics` gives :code:`00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v3/4th Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 06)`. Not surprisingly, Wayland works quite well on it. I went ahead and participated in the `Wayland test day`_ from this one already.

My laptop, on the other hand, has a hybrid Nvidia card, though, and runs on nouveau. Somehow it didn't handle Wayland too well. I've had to switch back to X in the meantime. I'm going to head home in a bit and redo the test day with that machine too (I'll update this post when I do.)

A couple of issues with Wayland seem to be known already and are being worked on as I write. So, please do check the bugs folks have filed in the test day matrix and the `Wayland tracker bug <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1277927>`__ before you file any new ones. The ones I ran into are below. Most of them are known already:
