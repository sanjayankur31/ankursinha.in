So, I was going through my Java test papers (I have my endsem coming
up). Here's a question that really shocked me.. I din't know the answer,
obviously :D.. So here it is for all coders who think they know Java::

**- List the Java buzzwords? [2marks in a 20 Marks paper]**

Can you answer that?? If you can't, you don't know Java!!!

There are 8 "buzzwords" , so you get a quarter mark for each.

Now you why I was shocked ;)

Needless to say, the teachers here love Mr.Schildt too much. I thought
the subject was Programming using Java, not Java using Mr.Schildt. :(
