I only worked 4 days this week. I had to rush back to college for my
evaluations and had to request Susmit to give me some time off to handle
it. I just got back today. The first order of things was to push
python-hl7 to testing. You can try it out using

::

     yum install python-hl7 --enablerepo=u*g

Please do give it karma :)

Orion has pushed an update to cmake which corrects this bug. Mario
appears to be away so I've requested Rahul to please bumpspec and
rebuild gdcm for us. He's a proven packager :)

I'm getting back to my tasks now. The three day "vacation", if that's
what we can call it, would hopefully help me work better :)
