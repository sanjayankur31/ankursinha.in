I've been off the blogosphere for almost a month now. No, it wasn't
self-control, I just didn't have a system to work on! My `new laptop`_
arrived two days back, and I've jumped into completing my numerous tasks
littered on my pending list. A blog post on Fedora 14 on the new system
(Dell Vostro 3400) is in draft and should be up by the weekend. Any way,
I found this nifty plug in today for Evolution. It is called
`evolution-rss`_ Neither do I need to use an extra client, nor do I need
to keep a browser open to stay up to date with what's going on. Give it
a whirl? Here is how:

::

    $ su -c 'yum install evolution-rss'

Close and re-open evolution.
