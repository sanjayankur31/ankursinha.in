:summary: I plan to take some workshops dealing with the robot operating system (ROS) and rpm packaging for Fedora.

I intend to take a ROS RPM packaging session at the upcoming `FUDCon
at Beijing in May`_.  With that in mind, I'd like to take a couple of
workshops to help interested parties learn the tools before the final
hack session, so that we can get some actual work done at the event. A
workshop a week should be fine:

-  **Week #1**: Introduction to ROS - what is ROS, why it'll be good to
   package it up for Fedora
-  **Week #2**: Introduction to RPM packaging - a basic introduction
   where we'll walk through the hello world package
-  **Week #3**: Introduction to SCL and ROS packaging
-  **Week #4**: Q&A session

The FUDCon is still 7 weeks away. That gives us enough time.

Please forward this announcement to the regional mailing lists, and
anyone interested in the topics, **especially** people that plan to
attend the FUDCon and contribute to Fedora as package maintainers.

If you'd like to attend the sessions, please fill in the `whenisgood
event organizer`_ before Sunday, April 13. We will begin next week.
