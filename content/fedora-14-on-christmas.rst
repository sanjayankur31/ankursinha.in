**"Somethings are meant to happen".**

My `newly ordered laptop`_ got held up at Calcutta due to some missing
paperwork required by the authorities to let it enter Jharkhand state,
where I reside. It was expected to take at the least a week more for the
confusion to clear up. I was upset since all my work had stopped, Fedora
and other wise. I had expected the laptop to be my new years buy.
Fortunately enough, `Blue Dart`_ called me today saying I needed to go
pick my system up. I was pleasantly shocked :)

The laptops here. In fact, it's what I'm typing on at the moment. Thank
you Santa!!?! ^\_^

I have pulled off the Ubuntu default installation they had provided to
free my system with Fedora 14. Everything works great! The smolt page is
`here`_. I've filled it up as much as I can. `Nvidia`_ needed RPMFusion
drivers, so did the `Broadcom`_ wireless. My finger print reader isn't
supported by fprint as yet, and even though I don't use it much, I have
submitted a plea to the fprint mailing list.

`Deja-dup`_ made setting up my user account a breeze and I'm going to
dedicate a fresh blog post to that when I have some free cycles.

Cheers!
