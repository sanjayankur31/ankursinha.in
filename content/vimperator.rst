I'm a keyboard guy: I don't like to move my hands off the keyboard to
move my mouse around or use my touch pad. Therefore, I was pleased to
run into `vimperator`_. Sure, a lot of you would already know about this
firefox add-on, but I'm throwing it out on the blogosphere for those who
don't. It's great! Give it a try!
