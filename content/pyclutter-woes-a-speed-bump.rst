Every task has some bottle-necks to overcome. The fedora-tour is no
different it seems. We've been coding using the pyclutter
referencesÂ \ http://www.clutter-project.org/docs/pyclutter/stable/index.html
which are valid for pyclutter 1.0.0. The fedora repos only sport a 0.9.2
, because (I'm guessing here) of no 1.0.0 release of the pyclutter-gtk
and pyclutter-gst packages. These two have their latest release stuck at
0.9.2.

The thing is, the 1.0.0 release has better , more advanced event
handling (that's all I've come across till now from the difference in
the online reference of the 1.0.0 and the pydoc reference of 0.9.2).
I've filed a bug requesting an update to 1.0.0 . Let's keep our fingers
crossed :)

/me goes to dig up 0.9.2 docs and to keep working!
