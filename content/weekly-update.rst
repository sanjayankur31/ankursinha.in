**This week till 3/9/10.**
==========================

**Here's what I've been up to this week.**

**Fried Chicken ROCKS!**
------------------------

I've been eating a\ **LOT**\ of chicken this week. I'm having this
awesome INR 65 combo from the "Asian Flava" Stall at the Food Court. It
carries:

#. a plate full of **rice**.
#. A **chicken** of  choice (choose from "Sambal" chicken, Fried
   chicken, Curry chicken) -> 3 pieces
#. **Lettuce**\ and\ **veggies**-> not my favourite, but I do eat them.
#. **Gravy** of choice ("Sambal" or Curry)
#. a **Fried egg** (you can take extra ones at INR 5 each) -> YUMMY

I've had different combinations of the combo all week. It's not too
expensive, it's delicious, it's filling and healthy, and they don't keep
you waiting!! What more can I ask for? :P

**Broken Twitter**
------------------

Do I need say any more? Dents, posts, and a lot more have been floating
around all over. `Pino`_'s broken. Should Fedora shift to Gwibber?
Should I leave twitter itself? Frankly, all the FOSS folks are there on
`identi.ca`_ anyway.

Unit Tests
----------

Again, do I need say more? Tests. 5 tests , 3 days. My subjects this
semester are :

#. Distributed systems
#. Neural networks and fuzzy logic (Elective 2)
#. Design of the Unix Operating system (Elective 3)
#. Artificial Intelligence(Elective 1)
#. VC++ (compulsory for all! :( )

I have VC++ remaining tomorrow evening, and yes, I do not want to study
it.

Fedora = nonsense?? [How dare you?!]
------------------------------------

Yes, someone on\ `identi.ca`_ dented this. He/She was denting negatives
about Fedora in Portuguese. I don't know how I understood (I speak no
Portuguese at all). Maybe it was the repeated "!fedora" +  "fail"
combination and the frustrated intonation of the dents. I went up to
`translate.google.com`_ and read up the messages. I got down to the
concerned party (in English, he understood) and clarified the doubts
etc. and requested him to not dent such nonsense.

Setting up my server
--------------------

Well, apparently setting up a headless install isn't that easy. (Here
headless = no monitor, no keyboard, no mouse). I got on to
`fedoraforum.org and was told to use a SATA/IDE to USB converter + qemu
to set up fedora on the hard drive and then plug it back into the
desktop server`_. The converter works, but there are some issues.\ `I've
posted on the fedora user's mailing list for info there`_. It should get
sorted quickly and then we can have the server functioning.

**`UPDATE: Apparently my hard disk is fried. (Sucks!)`_**

My remote works
---------------

See `previous post`_ :)

Fedora community stuff
----------------------

I ran a `thread`_ on the Ambassador's list about the Ambassador's Map
page. `Susmit says he'll make changes whenever he can find the time`_.
(Thank you Susmit).

I also ran a
`thread <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/private/free-media/2010-September/021239.html>`__
on the free-media list for a meet. That one seems to have gone sort of a
waste. :(

**`Oh! By the way, the free-media form is open for this month and
requests have started to come in.`_**

I came across `Alice`_ on a post to the `PLUG`_ mailing list. If
anyone's interested in packaging it, please let me know. I can help
reviewing etc. I would've packaged it myself, but since I'm not into
teaching, maintaining it would be uninteresting for me.

I've hung around on the IRC, #fedora. fenris02 / Ayakashi gave me a
cookie the other day for being helpful :D

    10:16  \* Ayakashi hands FranciscoD a cookie

I made new friends on the IRC/identi.ca too. (Our mutual love for Fedora
was the binding energy :P)

Development
-----------

I sat up one day and went through the `entire git reference at github`_.
I'm going to read up more and clear my git concepts once and for all! I
set up all my current development work on `github`_. `You can look at
them here`_. If you want to look at my code etc. review it, please do. I
like to learn lessons from folks, specially when they are as awesome as
all of your around at their work.

The\ `fedora-tour`_ is still at a stand still. Sindre got a new laptop,
and surprise surprise,  pyclutter segfaulted on it too . The server is
our last hope. Otherwise, we'll be waiting for the `bug`_ to get fixed
to continue any development of the front end whatsoever.

.. code-block:: irc

    15:57 -!- Subfusc [~sin@150.7.120.252] has joined #fedora-tour
    17:18 < Subfusc> FranciscoD, the tour segfaults on my new compy
    to, and it should run on intel graphics
    18:21 < FranciscoD> Subfusc: yeah, lets hope it does
    18:21 < FranciscoD> whats the conf of your new lappy? nvidia?
    18:23 < Subfusc> no
    18:23 < Subfusc> its some nvidia optimus crap
    18:23 < Subfusc> should run intel drivers
    19:10 -!- Subfusc [~sin@150.7.120.252] has quit [Remote host
    closed the connection]

**Fun and frolic**
------------------

This week's been boring and monotonous. Exams share some of the blame.
Continuous rainfall shares some too. My bike is lying at the parking
unused. Lots of music as always. ACDC + Alice Cooper + Aerosmith + ....
[ `my last.fm profile`_ ]

**Frustration**
---------------

Well, it'd be wrong if the entire week went by mellifluously. `Juniper`_
decided to come to campus to pick folks for intern-ships on Monday. They
have a lower limit on GPA at around a 7.5 (mine is 8.52). However, they
want a 75% + in both class 10 and 12. I had a 90% in class 10 and a 73%
in class 12 (*it's the Kota effect, if you're in India, you'll know what
this means*). Therefore, I'm not eligible to sit for the interviews or
even the written. Really, why do they care what grades I got when I had
*physical education* as one of my subjects? I'm awesome at Computer
Science. As of now, I'm still hanging free for my 8th semester project.
I've been mailing a lot of universities requesting a research based
intern-ship (even unpaid if possible), but the responses haven't been
very positive yet. I don't have a bachelor's degree yet, and very
limited research experience (only 2 months at the IISc), so it's hard
work getting something that's research based. \ **\*sigh\***

**Exams get over tomorrow, so it's going to be an awesome night. Info on
that in another post. I'm sure there's a lot that I've missed. Since
it's my first "journal" post, it's below par. I'll get better as I keep
doing this.\ *That's all folks! Good night!***
