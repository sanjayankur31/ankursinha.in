:summary: I am looking to pass on Fedora packages that I no longer use to new maintainers.

I've recently realised that I am now busy enough to need to prioritise what
tasks I undertake. Apart from my research work (PhD and related activities),
I'd like to focus my time on `NeuroFedora <https://neuro.fedoraproject.org>`__.
Therefore, I'm giving up a lot of the packages that I've accrued over the years
but no longer use. If any of these interest you, please take them from me.
Otherwise, I will orphan them at the end of the month.

I am quite happy to mentor contributors who are not yet packagers to help them
learn the necessary skills. You can become a package maintainer by helping to
co-maintain packages, as documented `here
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_get_sponsored_into_the_packager_group#Become_a_co-maintainer>`__.

I have already `e-mailed the devel mailing list
<https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/VDK46C23DKBCOHYO3EOCSLRJF2UUPDFK/>`__,
but also post here to ensure sufficient visibility of the note.
