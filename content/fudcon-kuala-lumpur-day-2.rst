Day 2 was the last day at the conference. We woke around 0700 again,
which is pretty early for me. I struggled to get ready and grab a bite
of breakfast before running into the bus that would drive us to the
venue.

Initially, the second day was to host `pre-planned sessions`_. This
proceeded until lunch, after which everyone unanimously decided to make
it a barcamp style session again. I didn't have a talk on this day. Both
my sessions had finished on day 1. On the second day, I was going to run
around and attend sessions!

I sat in `Praveen's RPM packaging session`_ to start with. Quite a few
people had turned up. However, a majority of them weren't fedora users,
so the packaging bit was going a little over their heads. Uhm, a lot
over their heads actually. Praveen finished in 20 minutes. The time
alotted to him was an hour! Christoph was to take a session on advanced
packaging, but he was still working on his slides. I filled in for a
bit, and gave the audience a very very very high level summary of
packaging. For instance, while explaining the spec file, I blah-blahed
most of the parts. I just explained what goes on, without going into any
specifics at all. They appeared to absorb some of it.
I finished up and ran to level 2 to attend `Aditya's talk on
puppet`_.\ `(He's uploaded the slides here)`_ I had attended an IRC
session Aditya had taken on puppet a while back: everyone other than me
had gotten puppet to work. So, I wanted to attend this second session in
the hopes of getting it to work. During the talk however, I realized
that puppet isn't a lot of use for non sys admin users. I mean, I don't
need puppet to control my 3 or even 4 systems. It doesn't quite make
sense to take the trouble. It's my opinion really. One might choose to
use puppet even for two systems. I recorded the session. If you're
interested, you can see it `here at archive.org.`_
After puppet, I ran to attend the session on oVirt that
"`wariola`_\ " was taking. Again, a video is available `here at
archive.org. <http://archive.org/details/oVirt>`__ It was a most
interesting talk. There was a lot of cool stuff that he showed. I'll
nudge him for the presentations and put them up someplace.
This was followed by a quiet lunch.

The post lunch program was re-planned into barcamp format. So, we had
pitches and voting. The first session was on some "User issues with
gnome3" or something. I sat there and listened. Personally, I felt the
session was a huge waste. It was like one of those rants and crib
sessions where one just keeps on pointing out his problems and follows
them up with "someone should do this, I'd like that". Well, you only get
your solutions when that "someone" is you. Talking about it, and making
jokes to an audience, ninety percent of which have never used Fedora
isn't going to do anything. I didn't speak at all during the session. I
kept quiet. I've learnt to not participate in such debates. I shan't say
anymore about it.

I walked out of the above mentioned session and went back to the main
auditorium for Izhar's talk on LXC. I've uploaded a `video of this too
at archive.org`_. He was clearly unprepared for it. With all the
organizing he was running around doing, no one really pestered him for
not having slides etc. ;)

Post tea break, we had the keynote. I've `put up whatever bits and
pieces of it that I recorded.`_ Abu Mansur put forward some really
interesting opinions and thoughts. It was a good keynote. I'm glad I
attended it.

Two Samsung galaxy tabs were given out in a lottery after this. I didn't
get any :(. However, both winners were from the organization team.
Christoph correctly remarked that each person in the organization team
would've been given one if we could afford it. Photo sessions followed.
Team photos, and the FUDCon collective photo were taken. Folks had to
leave already, and the parting began. It's a part of life really, and
I'm used to it. I still wished the conference would last longer and that
more folks had made it really. Anyway, no one cried :P

Back to the hotel, food, drinks, bed. The next morning Yogi and Dean
escorted us to the train station where the train would take us to the
LCCT. Flew home. The.. end.
