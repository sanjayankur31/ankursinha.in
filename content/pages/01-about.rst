    I'm Ankur.

I'm a `PhD candidate in the area of computational neuroscience <{filename}/pages/02-research-profile.rst>`_ at the `Biocomputation group <http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk>`__ at the `University of Hertfordshire <http://www.herts.ac.uk/>`__.
I'm also a Free and Open source software enthusiast and volunteer at the Fedora Project. Please take a look at my `Fedora  Users' Page`_ for more info.

I, like most of us, enjoy many many different things. Off the top of my head, I can think of:

- Food and drink!
- Music - generally rock - hair metal, indie. Bollywood at times. 
- Books - I'm a definite bookworm - science and detective fiction are what I read most.
- Sports and staying fit - I've played football, cricket, hockey, and squash while growing up. I used to play football every week until I began my PhD last year and nowadays I'm pretty much just a spectator. I workout a few times a week to stay fit instead.
