    I'm Ankur (pronounced :code:`'ǝŋku:r 'sInhɑ:`, and written :code:`अँकुर सिन्हा` in Hindi).

I am a conscious entity that aims to live life being the best I can
be---learning each day to be better each day.

By profession, I am a `computational neuroscientist <02-research-profile.rst>`__. I am also a `Free Software enthusiast`_ and belive in openness---`in software`_, `in science`_, in society in general.

I can be reached at :code:`ankursinha AT fedoraproject DOT org` or via one of
the various social media platforms linked to in the right hand side bar.

Cheerio!
