    I'm Ankur (pronounced :code:`'ǝŋkur 'sInhɑ:`, and written :code:`अँकुर िसनहा` in Hindi).

By profession, I am a `computational neuroscientist <02-research-profile.html>`__. I am also a `Free Software enthusiast`_ and believe in openness---`in software`_, `in science`_, in society in general.

I can be reached at :code:`ankursinha AT fedoraproject DOT org` or via one of
the various social media platforms linked to in the right hand side bar.

Cheerio!
