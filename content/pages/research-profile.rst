Biography
---------

I am currently a PhD candidate at the Biocomputation laboratory at the
University of Hertfordshire under the supervision of `Dr. Volker
Steuber`_.

Masters by Research: UTS, Sydney
--------------------------------

I have recently submitted my Masters thesis for examination as part of
my enrolment at the University of Technology, Sydney as a Masters by
research student. The title of my thesis was "Bio inspired navigation in
a mobile dynamic environment." I studied and modelled neuron sets that
are related to navigation in the mammalian brain. I worked on head
direction cells, place cells, grid cells and boundary cells.

Supervisor: `Dr. Jack Wang`_

Research interests
------------------

-  Neuro-mimetic systems
-  Computational modelling of neuron sets
-  Bio-mimetic navigation
-  Synaptic learning
-  Biological systems for robots
