I'm Ankur.

I'm a PhD candidate in the area of computational neuroscience at the University of Hertfordshire.
I'm also a F/LOSS enthusiast and volunteer at the Fedora Project. Please take a look at my `Fedora  Users' Page`_ for more info.

I thoroughly enjoy food, almost all kinds of music (although I tend to generally stick to Rock), and books - I can read all day. I enjoy tinkering with new technology and drinking beer while watching Football too, of course! You can learn more about me through the links below.
