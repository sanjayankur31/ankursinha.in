This is what I'm working on now. Unfortunately, one can only take on so much at
once.

Research
--------

My research work focusses on:

- homeostatic plasticity
- structural plasticity
- synaptic plasticity
- associative memory


Open Neuroscience and Free Software
------------------------------------

In my role as a volunteer at the `Fedora project`_, I am currently involved in:

- helping with the `Fedora Join SIG`_ that aims to make it easier for new
  people to join the community.
- helping with organising `Fedora Classrooms`_. (I also instruct a few sessions
  on Packaging and the command line.)
- getting the `NeuroFedora SIG`_ back up and running. It aims to provide
  neuroscience software in Fedora to make it a ready to use platform for
  neuroscientists.


Help wanted
-----------

- The `NeuroFedora SIG`_ is looking for contributors. It needs more people that
  can build and maintain rpm packages for Fedora.
- The `Fedora Classrooms`_ need more instructors. If you'd like to teach a
  session, please get in touch.
- The `Fedora Free-media SIG`_ needs help to migrate to `Pagure <pagure.io>`__.
  The Free Media programme is currently stalled until the migration can be
  completed.

If you can help, please get in touch.
