This is what I'm working on now. Unfortunately, one can only take on so much at
once.

Research
--------

My research work focusses on:

- development of the `Open Source Brain <https://opensourcebrain.org>`__ platform
  and related neuroscience tooling,
- corticocerebellar processing,
- various forms of plasticity: homeostatic, structural, synaptic
- associative memory


Open Neuroscience and Free Software
------------------------------------

In my role as a volunteer at the `Fedora project`_, I am currently involved in:

- helping in building and maintaining `NeuroFedora`_ . It aims to provide
  neuroscience software in Fedora to make it a ready to use platform for
  neuroscientists.
- helping with the `Fedora Join SIG`_ that aims to make it easier for new
  people to join the community.

Help wanted
-----------

- `NeuroFedora`_ is looking for contributors. It needs more people that
  can build and maintain rpm packages for Fedora.
- The `Fedora Classrooms`_ need more instructors. If you'd like to teach a
  session, please get in touch.

If you can help, please get in touch.
