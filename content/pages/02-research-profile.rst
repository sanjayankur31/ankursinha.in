:slug: 02-research-profile

I'm a computer science major that has migrated over to computational neuroscience over the years. Currently, I research plasticity---structural, and synaptic, Hebbian, and homoeostatic---and associative memory.

Among other tools, I use the `NEST neural simulator <nest-simulator.org/>`__ quite a bit. I prefer Python to Matlab, and `Open source software to proprietary tools <http://opensourceforneuroscience.org/>`__ in general.


Education
----------

Ph.D. candidate at UH Biocomputation
======================================

(2014 - present)

`PhD candidate in computational neuroscience <{filename}/pages/02-research-profile.rst>`_ at the `Biocomputation group <http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk>`__ at the `University of Hertfordshire <http://www.herts.ac.uk/>`__.

Supervisor: `Dr. Volker Steuber`_

Masters by Research: UTS, Sydney
=================================

(2012 - 2014)

I completed my ME (by research) at the `University of Technology, Sydney <http://www.uts.edu.au/>`__. I studied and modelled neuron sets that are related to navigation in the mammalian brain using the `ROS robotic framework <http://www.ros.org/>`__. I worked on head direction cells, place cells, grid cells, and boundary cells.

Supervisor: `Dr. Jack Wang`_

Thesis: `Bio inspired navigation in a mobile dynamic environment`_

OCNS
----

I am a member of the `Board of Directors for Organisation for Computational
Neuroscience (OCNS) <https://www.cnsorg.org/board-of-directors>`__, where I am
in-charge of the web resources used by OCNS.

If you see an issue with any of the OCNS web resources, please let me know (or
file an issue on Github `here

NeuroFedora: Free Software for Free Neuroscience
-------------------------------------------------

I am part of the team that builds and maintains `NeuroFedora`_. Our goal is to
provide a large set of neuroscience software to users in an easy, ready to use
way---via the Fedora_ Linux distribution.
