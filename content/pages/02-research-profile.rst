I'm still working on getting my doctorate in Computer Science. My research interests include plasticity, associative memory, recurrent spiking neural networks, bio-mimetic robotics. There are quite a few other topics I muse about but I general haven't the time to actually research them at the moment.

PhD candidate at Herts
----------------------

I am currently a PhD candidate at the Biocomputation laboratory at the University of Hertfordshire. I study the capacity of associative memory in networks and the effect that plasticity has on it.

Supervisor: `Dr. Volker Steuber`_

Masters by Research: UTS, Sydney
--------------------------------

I have recently submitted my Masters thesis for examination as part of my enrolment at the University of Technology, Sydney as a Masters by research student. The title of my thesis was "Bio inspired navigation in a mobile dynamic environment." I studied and modelled neuron sets that are related to navigation in the mammalian brain. I worked on head direction cells, place cells, grid cells and boundary cells.
