I'm a computer science major that has migrated over to computational neuroscience over the years. Currently, I research plasticity - structural, and synaptic, Hebbian, and homoeostatic - and associative memory.

Among other tools, I use the `NEST neural simulator <nest-simulator.org/>`__ quite a bit. I prefer Python to Matlab, and `Open source software to proprietary tools <http://opensourceforneuroscience.org/>`__ in general.

I am part of the team that builds and maintains `NeuroFedora`_. Our goal is to
provide a large set of neuroscience software to users in an easy, ready to use
way---via the Fedora_ Linux distribution.

Ph.D. candidate at Herts
------------------------

(2014 - present)

`PhD candidate in computational neuroscience <{filename}/pages/02-research-profile.rst>`_ at the `Biocomputation group <http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk>`__ at the `University of Hertfordshire <http://www.herts.ac.uk/>`__.

Supervisor: `Dr. Volker Steuber`_

Masters by Research: UTS, Sydney
---------------------------------

(2012 - 2014)

I completed my ME (by research) at the `University of Technology, Sydney <http://www.uts.edu.au/>`__. I studied and modelled neuron sets that are related to navigation in the mammalian brain using the `ROS robotic framework <http://www.ros.org/>`__. I worked on head direction cells, place cells, grid cells, and boundary cells.

Supervisor: `Dr. Jack Wang`_

Thesis: `Bio inspired navigation in a mobile dynamic environment`_
