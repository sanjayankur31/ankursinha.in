I'm still working on getting my doctorate in Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire. I work in computational neuroscience and my interests include plasticity - both structural and synaptic, associative memory, recurrent spiking neural networks, bio-mimetic robotics and so on. There are quite a few other topics I muse about but I generally haven't the time to actually research them at the moment.

PhD candidate at Herts
----------------------

I am currently a PhD candidate at the Biocomputation laboratory at the University of Hertfordshire. I study the capacity of associative memory in networks and the effect that plasticity has on it.

Supervisor: `Dr. Volker Steuber`_

Masters by Research: UTS, Sydney
--------------------------------

I recently completed my ME (by reserach) from the University of Technology, Sydney. The title of my thesis was "Bio inspired navigation in a mobile dynamic environment." I studied and modelled neuron sets that are related to navigation in the mammalian brain using the ROS robotic framework. I worked on head direction cells, place cells, grid cells and boundary cells. 

Supervisor: `Dr. Jack Wang`_

Thesis: `Bio inspired navigation in a mobile dynamic environment`_
