:slug: 02-research-profile

I'm a computer science major that has migrated over to computational neuroscience over the years.
I am interested in various areas of neuroscience---structural, synaptic, homeostatic plasticity; cortical and cerebellar processing; tools for neural modelling at various levels of detail and standardisation of computational models, and also the plethora of tools for data analysis.

I prefer Python to Matlab, and `Open source software to proprietary tools <http://opensourceforneuroscience.org/>`__.

Research Fellow at the Silver Lab at UCL
==========================================

(March 2020 - )

I am currently a research fellow at the `Silver Lab <https://silverlab.org>`__ at `University College London <https://ucl.ac.uk>`__.
Apart from the research projects that are ongoing at the research group, I also focus on the development of the `Open Source Brain <https://opensourcebrain.org>`__ platform and associated technologies.


Visiting Lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire
====================================================

(2014 - 2020)

I was a visiting lecturer at the School of Engineering, Computer Science, Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics at UH.
I taught on modules related to computing, and supervised undergraduate and post-graduate projects.

Education
----------

Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience: UH Biocomputation
=======================================================

(2014 - 2020)

I earned my Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience at the `Biocomputation group <http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk>`__ at the `University of Hertfordshire <http://www.herts.ac.uk/>`__.

| Primary supervisor: `Professor Volker Steuber`_
| Secondary supervisors: `Dr Christoph Metzner`_, `Professor Rod Adams`_, `Dr Neil Davey`_, `Professor Michael Schmuker`_.

Masters by Research: UTS, Sydney
=================================

(2012 - 2014)

I completed my ME (by research) at the `University of Technology, Sydney <http://www.uts.edu.au/>`__. I studied and modelled neuron sets that are related to navigation in the mammalian brain using the `ROS robotic framework <http://www.ros.org/>`__. I worked on head direction cells, place cells, grid cells, and boundary cells.

Supervisor: `Dr Jack Wang`_

Thesis: `Bio inspired navigation in a mobile dynamic environment`_

OCNS
=====

(2019 - 2021)

I am a member of the `Board of Directors for Organisation for Computational
Neuroscience (OCNS) <https://www.cnsorg.org/board-of-directors>`__, where I am
in-charge of the web resources used by OCNS.

If you see an issue with any of the OCNS web resources, please let me know (or
