I've been meaning to package up NEURON for Fedora for a while now. From
the `NEURON website`_:

***What is NEURON?***

NEURON

-  is a flexible and powerful simulator of neurons and networks
-  has important advantages over general-purpose simulators
-  helps users focus on important biological issues rather than purely
   computational concerns
-  has a convenient user interface
-  has a user-extendable library of biophysical mechanisms
-  has many enhancements for efficient network modeling
-  offers customizable initialization and simulation flow control
-  is widely used in neuroscience research by experimentalists and
   theoreticians
-  is well-documented and actively supported
-  is free, open source, and runs on (almost) everything

Â 

It's quite an old piece of software. It took me a while to hack rpms out
of the source code. The rpms probably won't make it through a Fedora
review in their current state, so I've put up a copr repository instead:
http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/ankursinha/NEURON/

The builds work, as the screenshot below will show. I'm still new at
NEURON myself, so it'll be a few weeks before I'll have all the
functionality tested out. There are tutorials strewn over the interwebs,
please just search for them yourselves.

If you're a computational neuroscientist using Fedora, this is a little
bit of good news for you! Cheers!
