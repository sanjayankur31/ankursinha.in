So, F12's been released. Was awesome to see 580+ people on #fedora
during and after the final release countdown :)

Anyway, sooo many posts regarding "F12's been released" are already out,
so I won't blog on that anymore. There's lots more work to be done now
that it has been released!

-  Release parties!
-  More bugs to report!
-  More marketing to do! -> `diggup`_

By the way, if you happen to be a fedora ambassador, please be there at
#fedora-india on the morning of Sunday, 22nd Nov at 1130AM IST to
discuss what release parties we plan and their requirements.

Have a great F12!
