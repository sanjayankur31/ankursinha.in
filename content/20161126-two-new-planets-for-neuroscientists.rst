:summary: No, not heavenly bodies, feed aggregators.

Keeping up with research publications is always a challenge for researchers. There's simply too much going on. Most of us have a daily or maybe hebdomadal slot where we go over various journals and news. We use things like e-mail alerts, RSS feeds, and that sort of thing. I have a `rather long list of RSS feeds <https://github.com/sanjayankur31/feedlists>`__ set up in the excellent `Liferea <https://lzone.de/liferea/>`__ reader myself. 

Now, the one problem with using a desktop application is that it must be set up on every machine that you use - even on your phone. This isn't ideal, really. It is also not ideal that we all end up having our own private lists. So, I tinkered with `venus <>`__ a bit and set up two new planet instances. Those that have been around the free and open source community will already know what planets are. They're web pages that aggregate feeds from various sources - usually community members. There are quite a few already. Ones I follow are:

- `Planet Fedora <https://planet.fedoraproject.org/>`__
- `Planet GNOME <http://planet.gnome.org/>`__
- `Planet Mozilla <https://planet.mozilla.org/>`__
