:summary: A great way to always have your task list on hand.

I'd `documented using task warrior to manage your tasks recently`_. I'd
only just mentioned **task server** in that post. I hadn't had the time
to set it up. The effect of this was that all my tasks were only on my
laptop and couldn't I access them when I wasn't at it. The simple
solution was to use an android client that would sync with taskwarrior -
like `Mirakel`_. In this post, I document setting up the task server and
then Mirakel. The previous post already documents how one needs to setup
and use task. You can use ``vit`` which is an excellent front end to
task. It's `available`_ in the Fedora repositories for Fedora 20+:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo yum install vit

Task warrior server
-------------------

There's already a `review request`_ put up for this. Threebean's working
on it. It should be available in the Fedora repositories shortly.
There's a `copr repo here`_, but it doesn't look in sync with the review
at the moment. I've run a scratch build and put up the rpms `here`_. You
can just grab them and install them locally for the time being. Once
you've installed the package, the instructions to set up the server are
quite straightforward:

Generate your keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo -u taskd #or su - taskd -> as taskd user 
    $ cd /etc/pki/taskd #this is where the scripts are placed 
    $ ./generate #this will generate a couple of new files 
    $ ls -l /etc/pki/taskd/ 
    total 60 -rw-------. 1 taskd taskd 1476 Jul 31 12:00 
    ankur_sinha.cert.pem -rw-------. 1 taskd taskd 6799 Jul 31 12:00 
    ankur_sinha.key.pem -rw-------. 1 taskd taskd 1489 Jul 31 11:57 
    ca.cert.pem -rw-------. 1 taskd taskd 6789 Jul 31 11:57 
    ca.key.pem -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root  root   666 Jan 16  2014 
    generate -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root  root   647 Jan 16  2014 
    generate.ca -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root  root   787 Jan 16  2014 
    generate.client -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root  root   878 Jan 16  2014 
    generate.crl -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root  root   792 Jan 16  2014 
    generate.server -rw-------. 1 taskd taskd 1521 Jul 31 11:57 
    server.cert.pem -rw-------. 1 taskd taskd  808 Jul 31 11:57 
    server.crl.pem -rw-------. 1 taskd taskd 6796 Jul 31 11:57 
    server.key.pem 
    [asinha@ankur-laptop  ~]$

When you run the ``generate`` script, it'll generate a
``client.cert.pem`` and ``client.key.pm``. I've renamed them to match
the user that I'll create in the next section.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mv client.cert.pem ankur_sinha.cert.pem $ mv client.key.pem ankur_sinha.key.pem

Set up a user
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Choose your username and organization. For example, I picked "Ankur
Sinha" as my username and "Personal" as the organization.

.. code-block:: bash

    taskd add org ORGNAME --data /var/lib/taskd taskd add user ORGNAME USERNAME --data /var/lib/taskd

This will generate a **unique key** for your user. Please note it
down. It is required when you setup your client to sync with the task
server. You can have multiple users set up. Each will be given a unique
key.

Start taskd
^^^^^^^^^^^

It should be as simple as:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo systemctl start taskd.service

If this doesn't work, for some reason, try this:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo taskd server --data /var/lib/taskd --daemon

Set up your client
------------------

You need to copy the client keys to your client's configuration
directory. For example, if you're using the client and server on the
same machine, you need to copy the client certs to ~/.task. In my case,
to set up the task client I did:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo -i $ cd /etc/pki/taskd 
    $ cp ankur_sinha*pem ~asinha/.task #client keys 
    $ cp ca.cert.pem ~asinha/.task #signing certificate 
    $ chown asinha:asinha ~/asinha/.task/*.pem #make sure the permissions are limited to your user only

Configuring task
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to configure your client to use the credentials that you
created, and to point it to your server. You can either modify
``~/.taskrc`` by hand, or use the ``task config`` command - they both do
the same thing. To edit it by hand, I did:

.. code-block:: bash

    taskd.server=localhost:6544 taskd.credentials=Personal/Ankur Sinha/my-long-key

    taskd.certificate=/home/asinha/.task/ankur\_sinha.cert.pem
    taskd.key=/home/asinha/.task/ankur\_sinha.key.pem
    taskd.ca=/home/asinha/.task/ca.cert.pem
    taskd.trust=yes

If I'd used the ``task config`` command, it'd be this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ task config taskd.certificate ~/.task/ankur_sinha.cert.pem 
    $ task config taskd.key         ~/.task/ankur_sinha.key.pem 
    $ task config taskd.ca          ~/.task/ca.cert.pem 
    $ task config taskd.server      localhost:6544 #on Fedora, we use 6544 for taskd 
    $ task config taskd.credentials 'Personal/Ankur Sinha/my-long-key'

Sync up!
^^^^^^^^

That's all the setup you need. Now, you run your first sync:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ task sync init

In the future, you just need to run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ task sync

All of this is well documented at the taskwarrior website here:
http://taskwarrior.org/docs/server_setup.html

Setting up Mirakel
------------------

Mirakel is quite easy to setup too. You can use the same credentials
for the user you created to get Mirakel to sync with your task server.
There's one main difference - instead of placing your certificate files
in a folder, you need to quote the keys in the file itself. For example,
my Mirakel configuration file looks like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    username: Ankur Sinha org: Personal user key: my-long-key server : your-servers-hostname:6544

    Client.cert:
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    # PLACE contents of ~/.task/ankur\_sinha.cert.pem here
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----

    Client.key:
    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    # PLACE KEY FROM ~/.task/ankur\_sinha.key.pem here
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

    ca.cert:
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    # PLACE CONTENTS OF ~/.task/ca.cert.pem here
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----

Once your configuration file is ready, place it on your android
device and add a new Mirakel user using this file:

.. code-block:: bash

    Menu > Settings > Sync > Add (button on top right) > Taskwarrior > Select config file.

.. figure:: {filename}/images/2014-07-31-04.39.19.png

    :scale: 25 %
    :target: {filename}/images/2014-07-31-04.39.19.png
    :alt: Mirakel screenshot

It'll add a new user. You can then play around with the settings and set
up your sync frequency etc. These steps are quite clearly documented
here: http://mirakel.azapps.de/taskwarrior.html. However, they're not
tailored to use the Fedora rpms, which is why I thought it'd be good to
write up fresh instructions.

Now, you have Mirakel up and running:

A couple of things to keep in mind
----------------------------------

-  Your credentials need to be correct
-  Your server should be reachable. This implies that the network should
   be functional, and the port should be open in the firewall. Please
   note that you may have to specify the zone if you're using firewalld.
-  Check ``/var/lib/taskd/config`` to see if Mirakel has permissions to
   sync. It isn't in the access list by default.
-  The sync is two way. You can add tasks on your phone and they'll be
   listed in task on your laptop after you sync them all up.

If you run into trouble, check ``/var/log/taskd.log`` to start with. It
logs accesses, syncs and errors too.

EDIT: Updated generation portion.
