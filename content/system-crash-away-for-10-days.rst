As the title reads, my system crashed in the morning today. It's not the
hard disk. It looks like the mother board is fried. The system has been
sent for repair. Therefore until I get a new system, or this one
repaired,  I will not be able to respond to emails, review requests etc.
I regret the inconvenience this causes to any one.  It should hopefully
only be till the 21st of this month.
