:summary: I was looking for a pdf viewer that supported multiple monitors. pdfpc fits just right.
:slug: pdfpc

I had a presentation to make and while `LaTeX and Beamer`_ make it very easy to make multi-monitor presentations `with notes`_ and so on, I couldn't find a PDF viewer for Linux that would project the files correctly. Evince doesn't seem to have the feature, and none of the other ones I tried had it either. After some looking, I found pdfpc. It works really well and is actively developed. `Take a look at the website here`_. I've packaged it for Fedora already but haven't submitted a review ticket yet. While I do, and the new package ticket is reviewed and the package installable from the Fedora repositories, you can get it from the `copr repository here`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo dnf enable copr ankursinha/pdfpc
    $ sudo dnf install pdfpc

    # To use it
    $ pdfpc pdfpc-demo.pdf

    # Also look at the man page
    $ man pdfpc

I'll update the post once the package is available in Fedora. Cheerio!
