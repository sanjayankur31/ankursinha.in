I finally decided to take the step. I've packaged 4-5 fonts, and I think
I get the SPEC file now. Atleast for font packages.

I'm trying a hand at app packaging now. Rahul (Sundaram) suggested me a
few simple ones I could sart with on the fedora-india list. I've begun
working on "`panini`_\ " . It's my first, so it is a challenge. The new
bunchload of macros is already making me google, and look here, ask
there.

Let's hope I get there in one piece. :D
