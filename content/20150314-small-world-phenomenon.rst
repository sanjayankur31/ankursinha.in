**Definition**: A small-world network refers to an ensemble of networks in which the mean geodesic (i.e., shortest-path) distance between nodes increases sufficiently slowly as a function of the number of nodes in the network. The term is often applied to a single network in such a family, and the term "small-world network" is also used frequently to refer specifically to a Watts-Strogatz toy network.[#]_

Stanley Milgram's paper documented a very very interesting sociological experiment in his paper[#]_, which he aptly began with:

    *Fred jones of Peoria, sitting in a sidewalk cafe in Tunis, and needing a light for his cigarette, asks the main at the next table for a match. They fall into conversatin; the stranger is an Englishman who, it turns out, spent several months in Detroit studying the operation of an interchangeable-bottlecap-factory. "I know it's a foolist question," says Jones, "but did you ever by any chance run into a fellow named Ben Arkadian? He's an old friend of mine, manages a chain of supermarkts in Detroit..."*

    *"Arkadian, Arkadian," the Englishman mutters. "Why, upon my soul, I believe I do! Small chap, very energetic, raised merry hell with the factory over a shipment of defective bottlecaps."*

    *"No kidding!" Jones exclaims in amazement.*

    *"Good lord, it's a small word, isn't it?"*

Simply put, he asked the question - *"consider yourself and any other person on the planet - what is the probability that you will know each other, directly or via mutual acquaintances?"* You'd be surprised how small the number is.

The small-world phenomenon isn't just limited to sociology. The wikipedia article[#]_ documents the other occurrences as well. While I'm quite interested in sociology and things, my current research deals with networks of neurons and associative memory. One of the parameters that affects the capacity of associative memory networks is the way the neurons of the network are connected and researchers have looked into small world neural networks.
