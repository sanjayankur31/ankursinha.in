I had wanted to swipe my system clean for almost two years now but the
convenient separate /home partition kept me from doing so ;). Â However,
last night, I swiped it clean, formatted the entire disk, and gave it
the awesomeness of Fedora 13.

It did take 900MB of updates to get me started, but the new Fedora beta
release feels great. I'm now going to read up the release notes' drafts
to update myself with all the new features. If you're thinking of going
beta, do it. :)
