For quite sometime now, I've been pondering over this issue:
`vim-latex`_ wouldn't load when I began writing a new .tex file. As a
result, I'd get errors such as ":TTemplate command not found". I found
the "bug" today. From the `vim-latex site`_:

::

    " OPTIONAL: Starting with Vim 7, the filetype of empty .tex files defaults to
    " 'plaintex' instead of 'tex', which results in vim-latex not being loaded.
    " The following changes the default filetype back to 'tex':
    let g:tex_flavor='latex'

Make sure you add this to your .vimrc if you want vim-latex to work as
expected.
