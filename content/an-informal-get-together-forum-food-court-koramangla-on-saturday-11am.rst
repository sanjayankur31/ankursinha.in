The title (and the image) says it all. Some of us fedora volunteers from
Bangalore are getting together this Saturday (14th January, 2012) at the
`Forum food court around 1100 am`_. It's going to be a very informal
session. We'll just hack around and have some fun.

You can use this opportunity to get your fedora related issues solved.
You can also come collect Fedora ISOs from us!

**We'd love to have you there! Cya Saturday!**
