I've been meaning to write this post for quite a while now. Ever since I
attended the session that Victor(Ting Chong Victor Yap) took at FUDCon
KL 2012. It was a most interesting session. I really wanted to attend
it, because the number of questions I get about creative apps that are
open source is too damn high! The session gave me a huge list of
applications to try out. I'm still going over them, but I thought I'd
share the presentation here with the rest of the community.

This is Victor's presentation. I suggest everyone take a look!
