In week 43:

- libneurosim_ was `reviewed and approved
  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1638968>`__ and is `currently in
  testing <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=libneurosim>`__.
  PyNN_ needs NEST_ to be built with libneurosim_ support, so that'll have to
  be done before PyNN_ can be submitted for review. That's next on the list.
- libNeuroML_ was also `reviewed and approved this week
  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1643266>`__, and is `now in
  testing <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=python-libNeuroML>`__. It
  should be available for use in the stable repositories in a week.  I can now
  work on packaging up pyNeuroML_.

There is a lot of software available in NeuroFedora_ already. You can see the
list `here <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora/PackageSet>`__. If
you use software that is not on our list, please suggest it to us using the
`suggestion form <https://goo.gl/forms/j6AJ82yOh78MPxby1>`__.

Feedback is always welcome. You can get in touch with us `here
