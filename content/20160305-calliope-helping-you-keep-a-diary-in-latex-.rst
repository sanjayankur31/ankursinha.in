:summary: Most researchers keep a research journal where we note down our musings, notes and so on. While a paper diary is still quite common, I'd really prefer something on my laptop/computer. There are various applications out there for journal writing, but none of them really match up to good old `LaTeX <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX>`__. I've written a simple script that makes it really easy to maintain a journal using LaTeX - `Calliope <https://github.com/sanjayankur31/calliope>`__.

Quite a few people write personal diaries - researchers tend to also keep research diaries where we note our generally brilliant ideas. I've used `Lifeograph <http://lifeograph.sourceforge.net/wiki/Main_Page>`__ for a number of years now. It's a great application with all the right features that a diary needs - chapters, tags, and  metrics. It doesn't quite work for a *research diary*, though - it doesn't support maths notation for a start, and we really do write a lot of very complicated maths from time to time. (The kinds with lots of symbols you see in the films? Think "`A beautiful mind <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/>`__".)

The simple solution, of course, is LaTeX_. LaTeX_ is used extensively in academic writing. While it does have a reputation for being complex and complicated (`YES! There's a difference in the two words - they're not interchangeable! <http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/10459/what-is-the-difference-between-complicated-and-complex>`__) at times, it is by far the best tool for academic writing. It has everything a researcher needs - citation support, can be customised to fit multiple format, and if you pair it with `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`__ you even have versioning and `change tracking <http://ankursinha.in/blog/tag/zaphod/>`__.

Calliope
--------

I went looking for packages that may provide this functionality in LaTeX_ but they didn't quite provide the required functionality. I ran into a `this Github project <https://github.com/mikhailklassen/research-diary-project>`__ instead, which is a set of templates and scripts that does quite a good job. I've forked it and made some improvements. There's now a single script that takes arguments, for example. I've also added support for indexing - which works similar to tagging - it'll generate a nice clickable index at the end of the document. Of course, I've given it a fancy name, `Calliope and put it up on Github <https://github.com/sanjayankur31/calliope>`__.

Usage is quite straightforward:

.. code:: bash

    [asinha@cs-as14aho-2-herts-ac-uk  00_research_diary(master %=)]$ ./calliope.sh -h
        usage: ./calliope.sh options

        Master script file that provides functions to maintain a journal using LaTeX.

        OPTIONS:
        -h  Show this message and quit

        -t  Add new entry for today

        -c  Compile today's entry

        -a  <year>
            Year to generate anthology of

        -p  <year>
            Compile all entries in this year

        -s  <entry> (yyyy-mm-dd)
            Compile specific entry


This is what the directory structure looks like:

.. code:: bash

    [asinha@cs-as14aho-2-herts-ac-uk  00_research_diary(master %=)]$ tree

        ├── entry.tex
        └── research_diary.sty

            6 directories, 11 files

The script generates your source LaTeX_ files and puts them in the folders in ``diary/``. Then you write up and use the script to compile it - the generated pdfs are collected in the ``pdfs/`` folder. The script can also generate an anthology for a year you pick. The resultant pdf for a daily entry will look like this:

.. image:: {filename}/images/20160305-Calliope.png
    :width: 500px
    :alt: Screenshot showing pdf generated by Calliope
    :align: center
    :target: {filename}/images/20160305-Calliope.png

That's pretty much it. Commit your entry to Git and you're done.

So, give it a go and please `file issues <https://github.com/sanjayankur31/calliope/issues/>`__ if you have any suggestions that would improve it.
