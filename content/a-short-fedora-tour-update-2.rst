The fedora-tour is finally picking up speed with Subfusc and me
(franciscod) devoting more time to the project. We've reached a stage
where we need the content of the tour to proceed further. This is where
the different teams come in. The content would mean that the docs team
gets involved :)

I've emailed the docs list and am waiting with anticipation for a reply.
