I have recently been busy helping my elder sister with her literature
review. I can not help her much in collecting matter etc. since I know
nothing about her subject (biotechnology), but I have been doing the
formatting of her review using LaTeX. A lot of her citations are from
the wiley online library. The site has the option of exporting
citations, but they are always exported in this unknown format (Unknown
to me!), irrespective of what option you choose. I wrote a small shell
script to convert this unknown format to BibTeX. It handles most of the
important tags and well..works. `Here's the gitorious repository`_
