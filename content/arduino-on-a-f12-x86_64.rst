I just started playing around with `arduino`_ boards. Â There's a F11
how-to given `here`_. Some things to remember for a 64bit Fedora.

-  `Install Sun Java`_ , a F12 x86\_64 system needs the Linux64 package.
-  Set up your system to use Sun Java as given
   `here <http://fedorasolved.org/browser-solutions/java-i386/>`__.
   (Step 5 onwards)
-  Follow the howto link I've given above.
-  That's it :)

As a side note, it seemed to work with OpenJDK too, (reset the
alternatives to point to OpenJDK and tested)
