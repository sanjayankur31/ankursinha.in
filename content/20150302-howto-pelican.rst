In my last post, I mentioned that I had moved to a Pelican based blog. In this post, I'll document how I did this, for myself as a future reference and for others that might be looking for a resource. **Yet another howto**.

Requirements
------------

- I'm using a Fedora_ system, but you can use another Linux (or not) distribution too. Pelican is written in Python, so it should be easily usable on any system that has Python on it. This guide will limit itself to Fedora.

- Pelican is available in the Fedora repositories:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo yum install python-pelican

- Git and a Github account

- Your favourite text editor
