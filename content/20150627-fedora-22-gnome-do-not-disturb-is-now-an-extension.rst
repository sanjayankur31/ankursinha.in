:summary: There is now a do not disturb extension for Gnome Shell that sets the session status to "busy".

Just a quick note.

`I'd written earlier about setting the Gnome Shell session status to "busy" <{filename}/20150616-gnome-dnd.rst>`_. The post documented how it could be done from the terminal. We'd been `discussing this on the Fedora Workstation mailing list`_ and one of the subscribers there, Norman, `went ahead and wrote an extension already`_! I tried it out already and it works really well. You can get it here from the Gnome Shell `extensions page`_.

It adds a button to the top panel that toggles the session status between "Active" and "Busy".
