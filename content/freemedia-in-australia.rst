I haven't been active with the Freemedia programme since moving to
Australia towards the end of last year. I've been quite busy with
university and settling down. Now that I'm no more new here, I'm going
to try and restart my contribution to the freemedia program and send out
DVDs here. The demands here are quite small if you compare them to the
volume of requests that India receives. If you're in Australia and need
a home burnt Fedora DVD, drop me an email at **ankursinha AT
fedoraproject DOT org** and I'll get back to you.

I'm glad to see Frank and the other freemedia folks working to keep the
freemedia program running. Thanks guys, you rock!
