The LUG Manipal, of which I am a part, is holding a "Linux OpenWeek"
here from the 23rd of March. As the name suggests it's an entire week on
Linux. We are an all student body and are just a year old.  In the past,
we've held install fests, workshops on Python , PHP etc. This is the
first major event that we are holding.

We will start with an install fest that features Fedora 10 :D , with a
local repo on a DVD that contains updates/other packages that users will
need.

We will give the attendees Fedora Stickers ( from the artwork page ),
Installation media etc.

The week has been divided into:

Introductory Open Source talk and Week introduction : Day 1

Install Fest : Day 2,3

User's day : Day 4

Developer's Day : Day 5,6

Hackathon, Free discussion : Day 7
