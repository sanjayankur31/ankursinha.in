    "The Fedora Project is rolling out some impressive new features
    and
    functions with Leonidas. One of the most notable is the use of
    ext4 as
    the default file system (while many distributions are planning on
    making ext4 the default in the near future, some recent releases have chosen to
    keep it optional this time around). The Fedora team says that
    aside from
    ext4 performance enhancements, Leonidas users will be treated to
    faster
    boot and shutdown procedures, an automatic font, codec and
    clipart
    installer, and the DeviceKit device management tool designed to
    work
    with (and sometimes stand in for) hal. Fedora 11 users can also
    look
    forward to updated versions of the KDE, GNOME, and Xfce desktop
    environments, improvements in direct rendering, and better volume
    control and power management tools."
