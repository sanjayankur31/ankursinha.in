Ma just got me a new tablet :) Well, it said Windows vista and mac on
the cover, but I thought I'd give it a shot on my Fedora anyway.

Googled around all day and ran up and down. Finally I found docs to make
it work. I've put up a `howto`_ on `fedorasolved.org`_ that's waiting
for review. If anyone needs to get their tablet to work, please do give
it a try.
