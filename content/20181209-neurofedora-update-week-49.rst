In week 49:

- `python-chaospy`_ was pushed to stable and is ready to use.
- `python-pynwb`_ was pushed to stable and is ready to use.
- `python-mne-bids`_ was pushed to stable and is ready to use.
- `python-dipy`_ was pushed to stable and is ready to use.
- `nest`_ was build with `libneurosim`_ support and pushed to stable. We can
  now provide PyNN_.
- The `GENESIS`_ simulator, `FiPy`_, `Spiking-circus`_, `python-pingouin`_ are
  all works in progress.
