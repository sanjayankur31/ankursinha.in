I've to present a seminar as part of my syllabus for the semester. I was
looking for one of those remote controllers to make the seminar COOLER.
Weirdly enough, I remembered that my laptop came with a remote that has
been tucked in and forgotten for a loong loong time. It presently
doesn't seem to work, probably a dead battery, but my next TODO item is
to get this working with Fedora. I'm going to get a new battery and hope
this works outa the box!
