I just finished sending out the emails requesting nominees to fill out
their preferences for the various town halls (on whenisgood). **If
you're a nominee and haven't received your email, please contact me
ASAP.**

As soon as we have the town hall schedules set out, I'll begin looking
for moderators. I'll announce the schedule ASAP so, hopefully no later
than June 5.
