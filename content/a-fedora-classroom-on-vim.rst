I intend to hold a classroom session on **VIM** on **Tuesday, December
13 at 2000 UTC**. Please mark your calendars. :)

To convert it into local time, you can run the following command in your
terminal:

::

    date -d '2011-12-13 2000 UTC'

The session will be at **#fedora-classroom on Freenode**. It will
concentrate on teaching people how to use VIM correctly, not the way
most people do -> in insert mode ;). It's a beginners' session, so we'll
start from scratch. We'll try to keep in within an hour.

**\*\* Prerequisite**: please install vim, vim-X11, vim-outliner

::

    su -c 'yum install vim vim-X11 vim-vimoutliner'
