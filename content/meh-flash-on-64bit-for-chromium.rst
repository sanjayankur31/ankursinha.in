There's an ongoing `discussion on 64bit flash on the fedora-test list`_.
I learnt that Adobe had yanked the 64bit flash plugin (***I call it
"meh!!", and it will be henceforth referred to as "meh!!" in this
post***). I went back to the `fedora flash page on the wiki`_ and
installed the nspluginwrapper etc. to fall back to the 32 bit version of
"meh!!". This works smoothly for FF, but didn't function on chromium.
The wiki has a section for chrome, but that didn't work for chromium
either. Googling gave me `this`_, which does somewhat work. "Meh!!"
crashes at times, but that is expected, right? I haven't added this info
on to the wiki yet. Wasn't sure if it was permitted or if this method is
correct.
