Thank you **dmr** Sir for your numerous contributions. You will always
be remembered. I wish I had gotten the chance to meet you in person.

A news link is `here`_. His `homepage at Bell labs`_.

A rather fitting comment from a `reddit thread:`_

::

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void){
    printf("goodbye world :( n");
    return(70);
    }

NOTE: Please do not comment with references to Steve Jobs and the
difference in the amount of coverage the two deaths received. I will not
approve/delete any such comments. Thanks.
