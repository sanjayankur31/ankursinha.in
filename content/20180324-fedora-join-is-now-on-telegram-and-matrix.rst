:summary: We set up new communication channels for `Fedora Join`_. Come speak
          to us!

As the subject says, we're now on Telegram_ and on Matrix_ now! If you'd like
to contribute to Fedora, come speak to us! Spread the word!

We're now on:

- IRC: `#fedora-join <https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#fedora-join>`__ on Freenode
- Telegram: `Fedora Join SIG <https://t.me/joinfedora>`__
- Matrix: `#fedora-join <https://riot.im/app/#/room/%23freenode_%23fedora-join:matrix.org>`__
- Mailing list: `Fedora Join <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/fedora-join@lists.fedoraproject.org/>`__

The Telegram_ and Matrix_ channel are both bridged to the IRC_ channel. So, one
can monitor any of them and keep in touch.

We're already seeing more people in the channels, and that's really great to
see!
