Week 16! Woah! That seems like a loong time :D

This week,\ `Spot`_\ approved my `xmedcon`_ package. In the process, he
even patched libtpcimgio and libtpcmisc to generate shared objects. (It
took him all of 5 minutes!) Thank you spot!! Now that xmedcon is
packaged, `Susmit`_ can go back to completing the `amide`_ package.
That's one more package for the `fedora medical`_ initiative.

I've been working on `gnumed-client`_. I've already received a review.
I'm just working on the fixes.

`ANTs`_ was on my list too. Unfortunately, it requires ITK version 4.
Version 4 is still unstable and the ITK maintainer, Mario, suggested we
stick to 3.2.0 for the time being. ANTs will therefore have to wait a
bit.

I think that's all for the week.

Â 

Happy Independence day!!
