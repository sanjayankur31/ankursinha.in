I use Alexandria for keeping a record of all the books I buy/read/loan.
It has a nifty feature where you can export your libraries as HTML
files. I've published them.\ `Have a look!`_ It's only a subset,
costituting books I've read since the second half the last year. (I
doesn't mention a single Enid Blyton, and I've almost read them all as a
kid ;))
