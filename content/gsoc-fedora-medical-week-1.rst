So\ `my proposal`_ for the GSoC got selected this year. I'm working with
`Fedora Medical`_ this time. Even though we're supposed to begin work
sometime in May, we've decided to give ourselves a head start and begin
work. My task for week 1 was to shift the packaging task info from the
`wiki`_ to the `fedora medical trac`_.

The post is only about a day or twos work, so a short one ;)
