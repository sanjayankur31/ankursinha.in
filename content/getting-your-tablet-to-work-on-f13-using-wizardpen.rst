As a lot of you would remember, HAL was dropped in favour of udev in
Fedora 13. (More info `here`_). I own a "UC-LOGIC Tablet WP5540U" which
I had successfully configured on Fedora 12 using HAL. Since I upgraded,
and the HAL configuration worked no more, a new configuration was
needed. For those still on Fedora 12, you can refer to this `awesome
post`_ to get your tablet working.

My post will describe the changes needed for Fedora 13.

**Using wizardpen to get your tablet working on Fedora 13**
-----------------------------------------------------------

#. Please check the \ `project page`_ to see if your tablet is supported
#. Download the
   rpm \ `here <http://ankursinha.fedorapeople.org/tablet/>`__ (you can
   also download the srpm and \ `rebuild`_ it). I had added
   this \ `patch`_ to the SRPM that enables it to build correctly with
   xorg-1.7. ( I haven't updated this in a while, maybe when I get more
   time)

#. As root, install the package using
#. Connect the tablet and run the following command to determine the
   name of the tablet
#. We look for the event associated with the tablet
#. Calibrate the tablet using:
#. You now need to add a configuration file for Xorg for the tablet. You
   can refer to the `Fedora Documentation on this`_. This is what my
   `wizardpen.conf`_ looks like:
