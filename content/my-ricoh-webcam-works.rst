I have a ricoh webcam inbuilt in my dv6000 laptop. I had an awful time
getting it to work , seeing the bad condition of support for Linux.
Well,\ `better webcam was a feature for F10 and really got a lot of
cameras working`_\ . Well, my turn's finally here. Firmware for the
webcam has been\ `pushed into RPMFusion non-free`_\ . It hasn't hit the
repos yet (I couldn't wait and built myself an RPM).

Bus 001 Device 003: ID 05ca:1810 Ricoh Co., Ltd Pavilion Webcam [R5U870]

so.. I'VE GOT A WORKING RICOH WEBCAM!!!
---------------------------------------

I'm indebted to\ **Hans de Goede**\  who has been working on this.
Thanks a bunch! :)
