|image0|\ In spite of a large contribution from the Fedora India Free
media volunteers this month (We've managed to accept and send out around
80 already, which is awesome!), we still have another 80 unaccepted
tickets waiting to be accepted. Â Can some folks please sign up for the
Fedora Free Media program and mail a nominal TWO medias please? It's not
much to ask, and we'll have to send fewer "we're sorry, please try again
next month" e-mails to people. Frank just sent an email to the list
reminding us that there's only about a week before the unaccepted
tickets will be closed. We need your help.
