    There were two topics on the agenda as posted on the mailing list:
    - F12 release events
    - Tamil team
    - During the course of the meeting, we decided to discuss the
    issue of
    "people becoming Fedora Ambassadors and not carrying out their
    duties as
    required" also.

    Minutes -
    Release events:

    - Planned at MIT Manipal, early January (Ankur Sinha)
    - Release party, install fests at Bikaner (Jaideep)
    - Plans to migrate 100 desktops of Coal India to fedora12
    (Pradipta)

    Tamil team discussion:
    Postponed (next meeting?)

    Discussion over fedora ambassadorship

    - Making sure that blogs of \*every\* Ambassador is on
    planet.fedoraproject.org

    - some sort of system to prevent people from signing up (because
    its
    ultra cool) and then not working.
    - make a nice proposal and send it for discussion and whatever be
    the
    result send it to FEMSco for approval
    - ideas, such as an Ambassador should be participating in at
    least one
    Fedora subgroup (ie docs/packaging/design/websites...)

    - Mentoring to make sure newbies holding release fests know what
    to say
    ie - \*correct content\* (since they're short on experience, we
    don't want
    them saying stuff that is different from the community's working
    etc.)
    - Setting up a wiki page and supplying people with updated slides
    and
    material to be used at release fests.

    - collecting feedback after a Fedora event from the audience
    (ideas
    needed on how to go about doing this).

    - regular IRC meets : fortnightly \*at least\*

    - good install fests never turning into sustained activities : why??

    ==========================================================================

    These are only ideas in short. Please go through the meeting logs
    provided above.

    There's quite a lot of work to be done.

    - I'm in-charge of rounding up all "FAs from India"'s blogs and
    making
    sure they're on the planet.
    - Slides etc? (any hands ??)

    There are also agendas that still need more discussion. Future
    meets or
    discussions on the mailing list are needed.

    Thank you all for attending :)

    Have a nice evening

    regards,
    Ankur

    PS Also forwarding the the ambassadors list.
