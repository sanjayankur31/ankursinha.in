Good news.. !!

Off the Fedora India list :

    Hi all,

    We are happy to let you know that Fedora 11 is coming up on 2nd
    June,

    Keeping the demand in mind and to ensure easy availability, we have
    arranged for Master copies of Fedora 11 for LUGs (without any
    charge).

    Any LUG with a proper contact person, is entitled to receive master
    copies of Fedora media from Fedora India.

    If you wish to receive media, you can either update[1] this page, or
    you can send me a mail at susmit AT fedoraproject DOT org.

    Please forward this message to LUGs that you know exists and you may
    be a member of.

    Thanks for your support to fedora.
