The title is significant, since I've been off blogging for quite a
while. It's positive since it shows that I've gotten quite a lot of work
on my head.

Here's what I've been up to with respect to Fedora :

#. Working on fedora-tour.
#. Packaging maintaining.
#. Helping out at #fedora and the other channels.
#. I participated in the webcam test day!!
#. other stuff :P

Other than that, I've gotten stuff from college to do. Exams,
assignments, ( :( ) internship project etc.

I started working with the LUG again after a dormant period. I forward
fedora announcements to the lists apart from the general discussion.

I think a short post's good for a comeback. Hope to post more
frequently!
