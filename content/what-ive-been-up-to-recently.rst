Most recently, I did my laundry ;). The transition from a college
student to a corporate employee is taking me longer than it does most
people. Since I'm due to start my post graduate courses in a few months,
I guess I'm subconsciously resisting the transition. I can't wait to get
back to studying! (Sounds crazy, I know!)

Anyhow, to Fedora related stuff. I've been trying to be more active as
an Ambassador this cycle. I've been attending all the APAC meetings on
Saturday mornings. I'm estatic to have been able to assist the APAC
ambassadors in the FUDCon bidding process. I don't recall APAC ever
being more active. It's great!

I'm working on the Fedora Videos project
with Nitesh, Mark, tatica, Buddhika, Onuralp, Sarah , Dan, Akshaya,
Sirko, Hoppar (and more people!). We're moving along nicely. The most
recent meeting was last Thursday. You can read the meeting `logs
here.`_ We've thrashed out most of the details: howtos, hosting, idea
dump, licensing but we need to get down and dirty to making our own
videos to really understand the process. I just filed a `ticket with the
design team`_ for a pictographic "how to make and submit a fedora
video". I have to make a screen cast, and also document the writing of
srt files this week. I'm also doing the packaging for them. It's just
one `review ticket`_ for the time being. It's a little more complex than
I had imagined, but nothing I can't handle ;).

We're also back to working on the `fedora tour`_ after a prolonged
hiatus. A small team has come together, and I expect to get down to
implementing code soon. The `meeting logs`_ will tell you the current
status: designing and deciding on the targeted audience. I've recently
managed to rope in Suchakra who is an excellent designer (he was
in-charge for the artwork for FUDCon Pune), to help out with the artwork
and designing for the tour. We need one more quick meeting to drill down
and agree on some details. Once done, we begin to code! (yay!).

I haven't worked on the `free-media tool`_ in a while. It "just works",
and with the lack of free cycles, I haven't been able to get down to
adding more features to it yet.

This year's `Fedora GSoC`_ is on! Buddhika is doing a great job really!
The idea list is here. If you have something in mind, throw is in
there.
