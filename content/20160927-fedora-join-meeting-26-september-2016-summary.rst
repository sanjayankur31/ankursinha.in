:summary: Salient points from the `Fedora Join Meeting`_.


We had a Fedora Join SIG meeting this Monday. While the minutes are `here <https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/fedora-meeting-3/2016-09-26/fedora_join_26_sept_2016.2016-09-26-15.02.html>`__, I figured I'll summarise them in my own words with the required context.

Reviewing past tickets
-----------------------

We began by going over tickets that were on our `tracker (now on Pagure!) <https://pagure.io/fedora-join/Fedora-Join/issues>`__.


#11 - Membership tracker - no pending membership requests
=========================================================

- https://pagure.io/fedora-join/Fedora-Join/issue/11

We have an FAS group, and a Pagure group to give members access to our Pagure repositories. The two must be kept in sync manually, so we've created a membership tracker ticket. To join the SIG, one can either comment on this ticket, or apply via the FAS group. The admins monitor both :)

#10 - "Fedora and the open source philosophy" essay contest
===========================================================

- https://pagure.io/fedora-join/Fedora-Join/issue/10

This is an idea we had a while ago. While a majority of us know Fedora's stance on Free software, it was felt that we don't mention it enough, mostly because we don't have to. It rarely comes up when you're coding or fixing a bug or just closing a ticket. This doesn't make much of a difference to existing contributors who understand the Free software philosophy, but maintaining a small but constant discussion of our philosophy will make it a lot easier for the newer contributors and users to understand why and how we are different from other distributions. It'll ensure that people that engage with Fedora, in whatever way, will understand that we're not just a software package that is available free of cost, we are a community that exists to support Free software.
