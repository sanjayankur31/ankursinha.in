I wrote this post for the `LUGManipal`_ blog. This post is meant to be
for people not aware of Preupgrade yet.

    Preupgrade has been around for quite sometime now. This post is
    intended to make everyone aware of Preupgrade's existence and to
    answer any queries regarding it.

    What is Preupgrade?

    Downloading a new Fedora release, burning the DVD and reinstalling
    the entire thing is very time taking and requires enough bandwith .
    Preupgrade is an application that allows you to upgrade to the
    latest Release without having to do the above mentioned steps. It
    only downloads updates to packages that you have installed on your
    system in the background, and runs the final upgrade once this is
    done. Hence, it saves time, bandwith.

    There's also the "icon way" of upgrading, ie, no terminal needed.
