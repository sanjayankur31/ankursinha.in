Edit : There's a list of\ `command line clients for dict.org here`_
already, came across if **after** I had written the script. What a pity
:/

So,Â 

::

    $ su -c  'yum -y install dictd'
    $ dict -f fedora
    3 definitions found
    dict.org        2628    gcide   The Collaborative International Dictionary of English v.0.48
      fedora fe*do"ra (f[i^]*d[^o]r"[.a]), n.
         A soft felt hat with a crown creased lengthwise.

         Syn: felt hat, homburg, Stetson, trilby.

Developers are lazy. Recently, I had published a post on `command line
text utils`_. One of the utils was to use **curl**\ to access the
`dict.org`_ database. I got bored of using the command again and again,
so I chucked it into a shell script. It's highly rudimentary, and
doesn't validate or check for errors etc. yet, but works.
