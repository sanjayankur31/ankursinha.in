We coders/developers/geeks are lazy. It's no secret. We like to get
maximum work done with minimum effort, which is beautiful. Being lazy,
and busy at the internship, I wasn't getting much exercise. My
internship finished two days back, and it's time for me to go home and
get life back into some sort of organized state.

I have this habit. Whenever I begin something new, I like to make
elaborate plans. (by elaborate, I mean ELABORATE). So I was thinking
about what schedule I'd follow this semester, what academics and work
I'd concentrate on and the rest. A part of this also happens to be what
I'd eat , and what I'd do for recreation (guitar?, play squash? go
skateboarding?). Now, for me, the worst time in college is MEALS. Why?
Well, I've got to decide what I want to eat, (is it healthy?), where I
want to eat, how much money do I have, who I'll call for company ?? You
get the drift. Being lazy + addicted to planning, I decided to plan my
meals and thus began the search for a diet/nutritional software.

I've found a few:

`Nut`_ and \ `DMAK (Diet Monger Ass Kicker)`_ are two that I'm looking
into at the moment. I've submitted Nut for a new `package review`_. DMAK
needs the Euphoria programming language. I've mailed the devel list
enquiring about the language. Lets see where it goes.

I also came across `Tapeworm`_, but lack of sources etc. diluted my
motivation to package it. It's upstream looks dead anyway.

Nut is a curses based application, while DMAK looks like a GUI
application which would probably be easier to use for most users .

Do you know any others worth using/packaging? Please let me know!
