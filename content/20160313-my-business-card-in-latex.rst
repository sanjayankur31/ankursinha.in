:summary: I finally found the time to make myself a business card, and of course, I did it in LaTeX.

I've been meaning to get myself some business cards - they're really helpful to give out when you meet new people - prospective collaborators and things. People rarely note down contact details - the business card works well as a handy reminder. I don't know how common it is for people in academia to have them - I've seen a few around, and I've also seen folks that don't have them. Anyway, I thought I'd give it a go in LaTeX to see how difficult it is. Turns out, not difficult at all. I found a `post that got me started <http://blog.widmann.org.uk/2009/05/27/1297/>`__, and after a few hours of tinkering, I've come up with this:
