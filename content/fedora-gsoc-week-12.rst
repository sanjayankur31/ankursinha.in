`Kradview`_ and `freediams`_ look like they're on the road to being
approved soon. Freediams has a little issue with shared sonames, and
I've emailed upstream requesting clarification.

I've just updated the `python-hl7`_ spec and srpm at the review ticket.
It's another easy package and should be approved in no time.

`vmtk`_ is ready for review. I've just sent a review swap request to
-devel. It depends on `OpenNL`_, which is almost approved.

The brunt of the work that remains is getting the submitted packages
reviewed. Almost all of the required packages have been packaged
already. So yes, I need you to review my packages! :D
