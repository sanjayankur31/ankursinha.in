Ah, `planet fedora`_ just made my day.. or night.. This post from Josh
Boyer is it.. It needs to be put up everywhere possible so people can
see it..

    **Fedora 11 Deltarpms: The Doom That Wasn't**

    Recently, Paul blogged about the awesomeness that is yum-presto and
    Deltarpms. I clarified that we weren't quite ready for F11 updates
    to have deltarpms enabled, but that we were working on it but wasn't
    sure if we would have the work completed. LWN picked this up, and
    apparently so did many other blogs and community members.

    So today I would like to draw your attention to:

    http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/updates/11/i386/drpms/

    Oh, yeah. That's right. What you see there is indeed deltarpms for
    the first Fedora 11 updates push. So Paul, you can un-edit your blog
    post now because we should be ready to go for Fedora 11 GA. We'll
    probably still have a few hiccups here and there, but the
    infrastructure is now in place.

    I'd like to highlight that Seth Vidal, Luke Macken, and Bill
    Nottingham were the primary factors to getting this complete. They
    did the createrepo, bodhi, and mash changes needed. I'm always
    pleasantly surprised when people care enough to start digging in and
    fixing an issue they care about.

    ***Fedora 11 is now made of that much more awesomeness.***

Looking forward to F11!
