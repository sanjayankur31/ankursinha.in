I finally got down to getting my infrastructure set up to send out media
here in Australia. I've bought and burnt the DVDs already. I went out to
the post office today and found out what the cheapest method of mailing
single DVDs would be. Here's a cost breakup:

   </table>

\* The cost of a single envelope is 1.15AUD. I purchased a carton of 100
that gave me a "bulk buy" discount.

There weren't any discounts on the stamps, so I didn't see a point of
buying too many of them now. I bought just enough for the current number
of accepted tickets.

I had found a post somewhere which said that one could use "C5"
envelopes for sending out media, and that it would be cheapest. I don't
think that's what I've bought. When I enquired about the "C5", the lady
at the counter said that it would be paper, and the DVDs would be
damaged since they're passed through machines for processing. I decided
to take her advice.

In comparison to India, this is slightly expensive. The cost of sending
out a DVD in India using "Speed Post" was about INR 40, which is a
little less than 1 AUD each. I could probably decrease my costs by
buying DVDs in bulk too, or getting media pressed, but I'm not sure the
quantities requested from here merit that much work ;)

If you've been waiting for your media, you should get it sometime next
week!
