I'm a regular vim user. Recently I came across the c-vim package which
adds support to vim for C and C++. Most of you are already aware of
this, for those who aren't here's a start.

You can get it here
: http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=213

Install directions are on the page itself. (It hasn't yet been packaged
for Fedora)

Since I'm pretty much a newbie myself with this one, I downloaded the
help HTML documentation \ http://lug.fh-swf.de/vim/vim-doc/csupport.html
and I keep it open with elinks as reference while I code.

Here's a screen shot of a class I created by going "+c" :

support"]\ |image0|\ [/caption]

 

It's pretty helpful once you get the hang of it. Enjoy your code.
