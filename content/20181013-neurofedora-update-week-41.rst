In week 41, we finally announced NeuroFedora_ to the community on the `mailing
list <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VXN4UBCNIL6BUCDRN55IGVK3IMO3HF6C/>`__
and on the `Fedora Community Blog <https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/neurofedora-sig-call-for-participation/>`__.
So, it is officially a thing!

There is a lot of software available in NeuroFedora_ already. You can see the
list `here <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora/PackageSet>`__. If
you use software that is not on our list, please suggest it to us using the
`suggestion form <https://goo.gl/forms/j6AJ82yOh78MPxby1>`__.

In week 41:

- NEST_ was updated to `version 2.16.0
  <https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/releases/tag/v2.16.0>`__. It is in
  testing for both `Fedora 28
  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-22afaeeee4>`__ and
  `Fedora 29
  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-6a80c3dbb1>`__. They
  should both move to the stable repositories in a few days. This new version
  does not support 32 bit architectures, so I've had to drop support for those.
- libneurosim_ has now been submitted for `review
  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1638968>`__. NEST_ must be
  built with libneurosim_ support for PyNN_ to work with it properly. So PyNN_
  will have to wait until this review is approved and NEST_ rebuilt.

I am hoping to spend some time on NeuroFedora_ every week, and I will provide
regular updates as I do. Feedback is always welcome. You can get in touch with
us `here <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora#Communication_and_getting_help>`__.
