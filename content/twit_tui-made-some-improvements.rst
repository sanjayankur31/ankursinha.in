Well, I can't keep myself from coding even during my endsems.. Got just
the one left.. JAVA.. and with questions like the one my `Java
Challenge`_ post showed, I really don't think I have much of a chance..

Here's my app again.. Made some improvements.. Elementary.. Will work
full time on it once the last exam's done with.

**Improvements** (if you can call them that) :

#. Remember username password. All you gotta do is make that file and
   put it in there.
#. Improved the send reply and update interfaces a little bit. It's now
   got character counting.
#. Handled most of the errors. This is still in progress. As more and
   more modules keep getting added, I'll keep doing this.

Please try it out and give your comments/advice. Please keep in mind
that I still am a noob Â ..

It's not a release yet since it isn't finished completely. It's so
people can try it out and tell me change things/improve things before I
do too much.
