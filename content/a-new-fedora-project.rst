A brainwave is all it takes.  My room mate just reinstalled his Windows
system . I was wondering around his system and I happened to notice the
"Welcome to windows" app. It got me thinking that maybe it'd be a good
idea if Fedora had something of the sort too. The goal is to improve
user experience while also making the user aware of everything that
Fedora has to offer. It's only an idea that Ryan and me have begun to
work on. (Less than an egg)

`Here`_ are the details. Please have a look for yourselves and comment
(the talk page?) or right here itself.

I thank Mel for all the clarification and direction she gave us this
morning. :)
