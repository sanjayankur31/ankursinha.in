Woah! Week 15!

`xmedcon`_ is finally ready for review. Can you review it?! Both it's
build dependencies were built and pushed to updates this week.

I just submitted `gnumed-client`_ for review. Susmit has already
packaged `gnumed-server`_ and it's available in the fedora repositories.
:)

The `FreeMat`_ package has been fixed too. It looks pretty good for
review now.
