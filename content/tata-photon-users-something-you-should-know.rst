Yes, your talk time is carried forward when you recharge to increase
your validity. But, it only happens if you recharge \*before\* your
validity expires. This is unlike cell phone connection providers, who
let you have your talk time if you recharge within a certain period
(generally 3 months) after your validity expires. Beware, time to set
your recharge reminders.
