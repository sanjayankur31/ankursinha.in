I've been working on an article on Fedora to be included in the first
ever LUGM magazine. We intend to release the magazine in electronic
format ( pdf ) during the OpenWeek via e-mails etc.

Here is the first draft that I've written for all of you to see. Please
feel free to point out any corrections / edits.

    **Fedora : “freedom”**

    We begin with a history behind the Fedora Project. The origin lies
    with Red Hat Software Linux (RHS Linux), the first Beta of which was
    launched in July 1994. A series of Red Hat Linux operating systems
    followed, the final Beta being released in July 2003. Thereafter,
    RHL was discontinued as Red Hat Enterprise Linux and the Fedora open
    development project dug in their roots. Within a few months of the
    final Beta release RHL, RHL 9.0.93 , codenamed “Severn” , Fedora
    Core 0.94 was released in September 2003.

    The name Fedora is derived from “Fedora Linux”, a volunteer project
    that worked to provide extra software to Red Hat Linux. The Fedora
    Linux project was eventually absorbed into Red Hat. The Fedora logo
    is a trademark of Red Hat Inc.

    The Fedora logo has a history in itself.

    As stated by Matt Muñoz, a member of the Red Hat design team, “A bit
    of background information -- we knew the new logo must be more than
    a text treatment (so people will perceive it as a “real” logo), be
    extensible (so subprojects can be expanded in a logical way), and
    that it cannot be a fedora (out of respect for the Shadowman and Red
    Hat's wishes). One of the members of your list, Fabian M. Schindler,
    wrote, “... a good logo needs to be simple, easy to print, with
    minimal distraction, attractive, dynamic, and easy to distinguish
    from other logos.” The following is our attempt to do just that. To
    create the Fedora symbol, we dissected the concept of infinite
    freedom into visual forms. We started with the infinity sign’s
    well-known shape. Secondly, we created a customized “f” to signify
    Fedora and freedom. And lastly, we gave the voice of the community a
    visual representation. Now we had the three elements we'd combine
    into the new Fedora symbol.”

    The online document also contains a gallery of the images that were
    related to this process.

    The quote clearly underlines the thinking and theme that went into
    the creation of the Fedora project.

    The Fedora operating system is used all over the world by millions
    of open source enthusiasts. As on 26th of January 2008, there were
    11,997,237 connections to the Fedora repositories. Among other well
    known users, NASA, Roadrunner (the number one supercomputer in the
    world) and various derivatives such as Red Hat and OLPC (One Laptop
    Per Child) are noteworthy. Linux creator Linus Torvalds is a Fedora
    user.
    The Fedora project has four basic foundations, the 4 Fs, its
    corner stones. Freedom, Friends, Features and First are the core
    values that govern us.

    “Freedom” represents the dedication to free software. It lays
    emphasis on the creation, usage and promotion of free, open source
    alternatives to proprietary or closed source solutions. Our aim is
    to provide software that is reliable as well as a hundred percent
    legally redistributable to everyone.

    “Friends” signifies the strength of the community. The project
    consists of people from different parts of the world with different
    ideas and views with belief in Fedora' s core values as their
    binding force. Everyone who wants to help is welcome at the
    community. Our decisions and steps are taken after a consensus is
    reached, as between friends!

    “Features” represents our commitment to excellence. Fedora is
    responsible for the creation and constant improvement of software
    that takes the Linux world forward. It is for the benefit of all
    users of free software regardless of their distribution of choice.

    Lastly, “first” represents our commitment to innovation. It
    signifies that every major step in the project is taken with a view
    of the future. Fedora is described as a bleeding edge distribution
    that always provides the latest available for Linux.

    There are different ways in which you can contribute to the Fedora
    Project. It is not compulsory for one to have programming, or say,
    knowledge on the Linux kernel in order to be able to contribute. you
    just voluntarily pick a field of your choice and dive in. You could
    choose to develop applications,or package them for users, or fix
    bugs, or help triage them, or help in uncovering them by testing the
    software that our developers release. You could even choose to help
    spread the word on Fedora, Linux and Open Source, as a Fedora
    Ambassador. All our discussions are transparent and are held
    publicly at the various IRC channels, mailing lists and the sort. If
    there is something you want to know or aren't sure of, you post on
    one of these and whoever can will clarify it for you. A channel that
    requires mentioning is the #fedora-classroom, the name is
    self-explanatory. In short, every contributor has his/her work cut
    out, and together, we make up the Fedora community.

    One of the more exciting ways of communication that is extensively
    used is Planet Fedora. It is a huge collection of blog posted by the
    community. The page is full of event reports, bug discussions etc.
    post after post. The page is ample evidence of the diversity of
    community members and their work .

    Before moving on to the operating system itself, the events that are
    held by the Fedora community are a necessary inclusion. The FUDCon
    (Fedora Users and Developers Conference) is one of the biggest Open
    Source meets that are held in the world today. FUDCon is a
    combination of sessions, talks, workshops, and hackfests in which
    contributors work on specific initiatives. Topics discussed include
    infrastructure, feature development, community building, general
    management and governance, marketing, testing and QA, packaging,
    etc. A FUDCon is always free to attend for anyone in the world.
    Various FADs (Fedora Activity Days) held at college fests and Open
    Source meets are miniature versions of the FUDCon.

    The Fedora operating system itself is currently in its 10th cycle.
    F10 Cambridge is the current release while F11 Leonidus lurks under
    development. Fedora is released bi-annually. The quick release cycle
    is aimed at quick innovation. Fedora is a RPM based distribution. I
    will not cover the history or working of the RPM in this article.
    Fedora provides a huge amount of Open Source software to its
    users. This comes under the F that says “features” . All software
    provided by Fedora is Open Source. The Open Source nature is a must.
    No software in the Fedora DVD, Live CD releases or repositories are
    closed source or proprietary. Software that comes under these
    categories is provided to users via Third Party Repositories such as
    RPM Fusion.

    It is beyond the scope of this article to cover the software
    available. It would require an Encyclopedia to discuss them all.

    Fedora is known for its commitment to Open Source. The community
    is proud to release an OS that is stable while also maintaining its
    status as the showcase for the newest that the Linux world has to
    offer.
    If you believe in the same core values as we do, join us!! Be a
    part of the community and help us in our endeavor to spread Open
    Source software around the globe.

    Fedora : Freedom \|\| Friends \|\| Features \|\| First !!
