I \*think\* I've unearthed another one of 'em bugs. Here it is.

**Before**\ hitting "Refresh friend list"

|Screenshot-GYachE Improved v.1.2.0|

**After** hitting "Refresh friends list":

|Screenshot-GYachE Improved v.1.2.0-1|

Notice the difference?? "Refresh friends list" just shows everybody
offline. I'm sure it isn't supposed to happen that way. Anyone else try
this and check?? The only thing that shows them back online is
"Disconnect" and "Connect".
