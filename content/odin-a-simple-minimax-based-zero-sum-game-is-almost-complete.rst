I have been working on odin, on and off this semester as my
mini-project. Odin is a simple zero sum game. I've currently implemented
a two player and a single player mode, where you can play against a
simple `minimax`_ based AI. It's autotoolized, so easy to install and
set up. It is ncurses based. Although it probably isn't up to the mark
as a game, one can refer to it for educational purposes, ie, if you want
to get a hang of ncurses, or implementation of the minmax. The code is
`hosted here`_ at `my gitorious space`_. Cheers!
