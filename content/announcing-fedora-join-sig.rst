We've all run into people who are interested in contributing. Quite a
few times, these folks are completely new to F/LOSS: the environment,
the workflow, the mailing lists. To make it a little easier for folks
looking to contribute, we've set up dedicated channels where they can
talk to the community. I hope that we'll be able to make it easier for
users to turn into contributors via this SIG.
