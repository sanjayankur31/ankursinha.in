`Robyn's just announced that the election process for the Fedora Board,

The folks over at infra `even set up a calendar on fedocal for the
Elections`_! I've added the important milestones related to the election
process to it. You can use an `ical export`_ and ensure that you don't
miss out! I'll keep updating it with more information, for instance the
townhall schedule, once I have it.

It's time to get started with questionnaires, nominations and name
suggestions again! Cheers!
