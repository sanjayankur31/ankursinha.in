:summary: Stop internet.org from controlling the Internet in India.
:status: draft

So, you must've heard about Facebook's plan to "bring the Internet to the poor in India" that they call internet.org. If you've read about the plan in detail, you'll see that it isn't really bringing the Internet to anyone. Instead, it's bringing some websites, a select few, of its choosing, to people that haven't been on the Internet before. So, people can only and *only* access these sites - not the Internet as we know it. Now, who decided on these websites? Not the people, of course. How do they learn of the *rest* of the Internet? They don't! As far as they will be concerned, this set of websites, termed "free basics" (is Facebook a basic requirement for the poor? hrmm..), is the Internet.

This is wrong, possibly noble, but wrong nevertheless - no one, and especially not large corporations with deep pockets, should control anyone's access to the Internet. Restricting people to a small set of websites also means that effectively *only these websites have access to the people in return*. Even if the idea of "bringing the Internet to the poor" sounds noble and wholly altruistic (and people love altruism, don't they?), it isn't the correct way of improving the state of Internet and infrastructure in India.

Do your research, folks.
------------------------

Anyway, please don't take my word for it, do your research and make up your own mind. It is the most important part of the process, the most important philosophy here - the freedom to access the whole body of information that will enable one to make an informed decision. The following links will get you started:

- `Poor internet for poor people: Why Facebookâ€™s Internet.org amounts to economic racism <http://qz.com/385821/poor-internet-for-poor-people-why-facebooks-internet-org-amounts-to-economic-racism/>`__
- `The save the Internet blog <http://blog.savetheinternet.in/>`__
- `Mark Zuckerberg's editorial in a newspaper in India <http://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/mark-zuckerberg-to-ht-net-neutrality-and-universal-connectivity-must-co-exist/story-oViWLaARpJ5q5Pk5P4eCbL.html>`__ - read carefully, note that he doesn't discuss at all how the "free basics" are decided on, and while he says, and I quote 'Net neutrality is not in conflict with working to get more people connected. These two principles - net neutrality and universal connectivity - can and must coexist.', he doesn't mention how they will coexist while some services receive preferential treatment.
- `Academics at the IITs and IISc also see the flaws in Internet.org <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-35197062>`__

If you agree with me and the thousands of other people that are speaking out against this misguided initiative, please go to the savetheinternet page below and follow their instructions to inform the TRAI.
