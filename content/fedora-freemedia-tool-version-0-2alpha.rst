I've managed to get most of the functionality coded up. Here's what
ffmtool -h looks like now (on my system):

::

    [ankur@ankur ~]$ ffmtool -h
    [+] Parsing available options from config file: /home/ankur/.config/fedora-freemedia-tool/config.cfg
    Usage: ffmt [Options] [args]...
    A tool to assist Fedora Freemedia contributors.
    Without options, it prints pending envelopes to the current directory using default values of input and database files.

    Options:

      -x [ --fas-username ] arg             FAS Username. Password will be asked if

                                            No command line option is provided to
                                            enter password to avoid entering of
                                            password in plaintext on the terminal.
                                            Use with -u

      -i [ --import ] [=arg(=/home/ankur/.local/share/fedora-freemedia-tool/report.csv)]

      -A [ --assign-to-lc ] arg             Assign these tickets to a Local Contact

                                            malformed and the splitter can't handle
                                            it.

      -V [ --version ] arg                  Package information: version etc.

    [ankur@ankur ~]$

Not bad eh? It's probably going to have quite a few bugs yet. I haven't
managed to test it out thouroughly yet. You can help ;)

Installation:
-------------

If you're on an x86\_64, you're in luck! `Use this rpm`_.

I haven't been able to build an rpm for i386 systems yet because of
`this bug in curlpp.`_

On a fedora system, you'll need the following packages:

::

     yum install sqlite-devel ImageMagick-c++-devel curlpp-devel boost-devel

Download the `source here`_

Untar it anywhere, and then, the usual autotool steps

::

    ./configure --datadir=/usr/share
    #datadir needs to be defined
    #this is where the envelope template is kept

    make
    make install # as root

That's all!

Example usage:
--------------

::

    [ankur@ankur SPECS]$ ffmtool -u

    [X] File format should be:
    1.1st line is a header
    2.One record per line (including address)
    3.Please ensure description consists only of address (personal message from requestor if any should be removed)
    4.Each new address line begins with a ",[[BR]]"
    [X] Example:
    [X] Number of lines in file without header is 27 while number of records found is 19
    [X] The difference suggests that some records are malformed. Please correct the records and use the -i option to import to database

Here, the file we downloaded was "malformed", because the ticket
submitter didn't punctuate his address properly (or added a comment).
Once you've gotten rid of the extra stuff from the data file:

You can use the various options to look/modify ticket entries in the
database. All this stuff will be on your local copy only. I don't see a
reason to update the trac info yet. The best part is, you can print your
fedora freemedia envelopes using this tool:

::

    [ankur@ankur fedora-freemedia-tool]$ ffmtool -l

| This is what the envelope would look like:
|  |example generated envelope|

You can print all the envelopes at one go, or print them one at a time.

Since I'm using boost::program\_options to take arguments, all the
arguments can be specified in the config file. I've also `put up an
example config file`_ that you can refer.

As always, feed back is welcome. You're welcome to review my code and
point out improvements! This was supposed to be a practice project after
all. You're most welcome to submit patches too! The `git repository is
hosted on gitorious.`_

Phew! Long post, probably the longest I've ever written. Cheers!
