It's been just about a year since I started my research career as a
masters student here at the University of Technology, Sydney. I'm
working on bio-mimetic navigation for this course, focussed around
computational modelling of head direction cells. This post is a
traditional "Hello world!" post and documents my work in general.

As expected, a research course is completely different from any other.
Firstly, I have no classes to attend, no assignments to work on, no
exams to study for.\ **This doesn't imply that I haven't any work**. A
year into my course, I think a structured coursework degree is much
easier to negotiate than a self structured research degree. For
instance, in a coursework degree, you know exactly what to study, you
have a fixed schedule to follow, you know exactly how you'll be graded.
In a research degree, however, you need to find your own material to
study, you need to plan your own schedule, you need to have results that
you think will get you a good grade. While students run off on holiday
after their exams, I still go back to work every day! The most difficult
part, perhaps, is the amount of self discipline that you need to
possess. I regularly struggle with this: waking up early, following a
fixed schedule, sleeping on time, following my day plan; aren't really
easy to carry out when you don't have deadlines to scare/motivate you.
As a result, I spend quite a lot of time in introspection (refer to my
`post on journal writing`_).

An introduction to my research
------------------------------

I work in an area called "**bio-mimetic navigation**\ ". As the name
suggests, it's simply about mimicking the various navigational systems
found in nature, and if possible applying them to robotics. Modelling
biological navigation can be done at different levels, though. I work on
a neuronal level with `**head direction cells**`_. These are specific
neurons that have been discovered in the rat hippocampus that maintain
information about the rat's heading. Of course, I can't go into the
details of the system that have been discovered over the three decades
of research here. The wikipedia page is a good place to start for any
one interested.

Why bio-mimetic navigation?
---------------------------

When I started off with my course, my research topic was much broader:
"mobile robot navigation in a dynamic environment". It was designed to
be broad enough to give me the opportunity to review literature and
decide for a focus area by myself. Like everyone, I began with classical
robotics. I read on `SLAM`_, `inertial navigation`_, sensor fusion and
learnt quite a bit about the navigation systems that robots utilize, the
concepts that make up these systems. A few weeks into my literature
review though, I tried to compare these methods to the way I navigate
personally. I found that I hardly used any of the classical robotic
techniques. "Why then, should robots use them?", I wondered. Curious, I
began reading on animal navigation, and ran into bio-mimetic navigation.
I learnt how animal navigation is very very different from classical
robotic navigation techniques. I now belong to a school of researchers
that are interested in developing navigation techniques from nature, and
in comparing these with classical robotic techniques. I'm very new to
the field though, but after this two year masters course, and a Ph.D. to
follow, I hope to be right in the thick of things.

My work with head direction cells makes my research multidisciplinary. I
need to know a little about neuroscience, along with my computer science
basics. Since I'm a computer science graduate, my knowledge of
neuroscience isn't as good as I'd like it to be, but it's getting better
every week.

Status
------

The goal attached to my masters course is to prepare me for a Ph.D.
degree. While I did know that I wanted to work with robotic navigation,
with neural networks, an undergraduate degree didn't give me enough
depth of knowledge to make an informed decision on the exact research
problem that I wanted to work on. The masters course, therefore, gives
me much needed time to read my literature, decide my stream and develop
skills for a career in research. While my masters plan is closely
aligned to my goal, I'm also going to try and make some contribution to
the field, however small. (It's always good to have a few articles
published when you're a new researcher looking for opportunities to
grab.)

At present, I've read many \*many\* papers on head direction cells and
their modelling. I'm currently working on extending one of these models,
my contribution to the field. I was recently assessed, and my assessors
decided my work was good, and that I could carry on my course here for
the remainder of the course. If you're interested, you can read view my
assessment presentation and my report `here`_. My assessment report
contains quite a comprehensive literature review. The reference list
will be quite helpful to people interested in the field. (If you do pick
any thing from my report, please do cite it).

I'm now engaged in making some contribution to the field. I'll post
again when there's something worth reporting. Cheers!
