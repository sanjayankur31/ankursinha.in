From Jesse's post on the list..

https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-test-list/2009-May/msg00853.html

    In a meeting today between Release Engineering, QA, and various team
    leads, we decided to enact a 7 day slip of the Fedora 11 release
    date. The primary reason behind this slip is the state of our
    blocker bug:
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/showdependencytree.cgi?id=F11Blocker&hide_resolved=1
    We cannot begin Release Candidate phase until the blocker bugs re
    closed or at least in MODIFIED state. We are not there today, which
    would be our last day to enter RC phase and still have enough time
    to release on the 26th. We hope to enter RC phase in the next couple
    days, and hit our new target,\ **June 2nd**.

    | Freeze breaks for critical bugs will still be accepted, however
    trivial
    |  bug fixes should be pushed as updates via bodhi. Thanks!
