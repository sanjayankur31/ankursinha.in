For those who intend to stand in this election, it would be really good
if you could update your user pages on the fedora wiki with as much
information as possible. If folks don't know what you've been upto, they
probably won't give you their valuable votes. ;)

For everyone else, this is a great chance to get to know your fellow
Fedora contributors! The questionnaire gives you the chance to squeeze
details out of the nominees. This will eventually help you give your
votes to the candidate **you** feel is most deserving. Don't miss this
opportunity! Your deadline for submitting questions for the
questionairre is **May 8**.
