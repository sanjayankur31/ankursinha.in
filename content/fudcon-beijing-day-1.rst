Registration and getting started!
---------------------------------

We didn't quite make it to breakfast on Day 1. We'd overslept and headed
straight to the conference. Registration was swift - the volunteers had
everything already set up already - project booths, registration booths
with our IDs, t-shirts, swag and the rest.

The conference begins
---------------------

We headed into the main hall for the opening sessions. Emily introduced
Kat and Jaroslav who welcomed the attendees and officially kicked off
the conference. The hall was quite full, which was really good to see.

Once the welcome sessions were over, Tobias talked about Gnome 3.12+. He
informed the audience about the planned features in future Gnome
releases, such as Wayland support and colour tinting to improve
accessibility. Jaroslav and Jiri introduced Fedora.next - the different
products, a little bit about COPR and the new ring system that we're
using.

Track sessions
--------------

This gave way to the track sessions that we'd all registered to present.
The Fedora track was in conference room 8.

Nitesh started the track with a session on Fedora Videos. The idea was
to introduce the project to people. We had quite a good discussion too.
Here are some things we found we could work on:

-  Can we translate the captions to our videos using transifex?
-  Can we also place videos on a website that would be available in
   China?

Both should be quite doable really. We hadn't really thought about these
before.

Fedora websites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robert introduced the Fedora websites project next. He discussed how it
was set up, and the ideas on Fedora.next. He intended to show the
audience a quick session on submitting patches to the team, but the
limited bandwidth didn't permit us (The Fedora websites git repo is
quite large).

We did get a few tasks from this session too:

-  Completion of the Ask Fedora skin, so that it can be better
   integrated with the new Fedora.next hub style website
-  Someone asked if the Fedora easy fix page could be translated into
   multiple languages

The Ask Fedora skin is almost complete, but it still needs some work. We
discussed how the easy fix page could be translated, but it doesn't seem
to be straight forward since it harvests information from the trac and
bugzilla instances. The static content could be translated. We need to
bring this up with infra, see if anything can be done.

FirewallD
~~~~~~~~~

Zamir took a quick overview of FirewallD. He discussed both the command
line and the GUI interface. I knew most of it, but it was quite a bit of
information for new comers.

Ansible
~~~~~~~

Fedora infra is switching form puppet to ansible. Aditya introduced
ansible with a quick tutorial. He discussed the logic behind the switch
and answered a couple of other questions that the audience had. The
infra team is planning a FAD to convert the remaining puppet modules to
ansible. There's quite a bit of work to be done if you're looking to get
started with infra.

Conary
~~~~~~

Martin spoke about `Conary`_. In spite of it being around for quite a
while, I'd never heard of it before. Martin discussed the usefulness of
conary. It was quite interesting. I met Martin later during the
celebration dinner and talked about it a bit. I told him about `rpm
os-tree`_ that I've been reading about on the mailing lists. I don't
understand them much, but they did seem slightly similar to me. Martin
said he expects to work a lot more with Fedora in the future.

ROS on Fedora
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The last session for the day was mine. I introduced ROS and why we'd
like to get it packaged up for Fedora. The audience wasn't using Fedora
on their systems already so I couldn't really do the hackfest that I'd
intended. I ended up showing them how to make a hello world package on
my system. The audience was quite interactive, and I received quite a
few interesting comments and questions.

End of a busy day
-----------------

All in all, it was quite a busy day. The talks were most interesting.
We, all the Fedora folks, decided to head out to dinner. I managed to
find a nice little `Mexican pub`_ on Google and we took the train out to
it. We weren't really sure if navigator would get us to the right place,
but it luckily did. We had some food - Aditya and Nitesh ordered a
gigantic pizza. Jaroslav, Robert, Jiri, Somvannda and I got ourselves
burgers. They were quite good. Of course, there was beer - an entire
tap. It was quite a good place. The waiters understood a bit of English
too.

We got back and went straight to bed. It was quite an amazing, hectic
day.
