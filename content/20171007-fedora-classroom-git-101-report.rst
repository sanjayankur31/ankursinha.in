:summary: I taught a `Fedora Classroom`_ session the other day - `Git 101`_ -
          where I walked through the basics of Git_. This is a quick summary
          of the session.

I taught another `Fedora Classroom`_ this week, on `Git 101`_. I used the IRC_
again since this session was to be another hands-on walkthrough. I reckon I've
now learned that hands-on sessions go on longer than initially planned. This
one lasted about three hours!


Some metrics
-------------

- Length: 3 hours
- Attendees: ~25 people
- Sentences spoken: LOTS!


Summary
--------

I didn't go much into the theory, and there's a lot of it in Git_. Instead, I
had made it my goal to walk the attendees through the usual Git_ workflow.
So, that's exactly what we did. We started by setting up an empty repository,
then added files to it, learned how to see changes and so on. Then, we moved
on to branching.

Once we'd explored the advantages of using branches we started working with
remotes. Everyone set up repositories on Pagure_ or Github_. To end with, I
got everyone to fork my repository and submit pull requests.

I think everyone got the hang of it. There were some good questions, a bit of
discussion too. I do hope it'll get more people to use Git_ and contribute to
different projects on Pagure_ or Github_.


Feedback is always welcome
--------------------------

If you had attended the session, or have gone through the logs and have some
feedback, please get in touch. You can use the Fedora classroom channels:

More instructors needed!
-------------------------

The classroom sessions are going rather well, but `we still need more help
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom#Help_wanted>`__. We'd like to cover
more topics from different areas, not just tech related- everything from
design, to free software philosophy and community building! If there's anything
at all you think is worth a classroom session, please get in touch with the
team on the `Fedora classroom mailing list
<mailto:classroom@lists.fedoraproject.org>`__. A log of all past sessions -
whether on IRC_ or on a video platform are maintained on the wiki page `here
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom#Previous_Sessions>`__ for everyone to
peruse at their convenience.
