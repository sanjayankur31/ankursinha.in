:summary: Linters_ are utilities that statically analyse source code and point
          out programming and stylistic errors to developers. They help write
          better code, of course, and while they're at it, they also improve
          one's coding standards by making one aware of common pitfalls and
          bad practices. In this post, I discuss a few that I use often and
          then go on to show how the Syntastic_ Vim_ plugin, integrates linters
          into the Vim_ interface.
