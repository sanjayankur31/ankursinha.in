My app has to get the xml from the twitter api for which i use libcurl
and its functions.. A colleague of mine tells me it would be better to
use cURL from within the program itself.. It would make curl a dep. and
as I can see from my limited knowledge, probably fork a new child
process..

Can anyone here clarify what should be the correct approach with reason?

If its better to use cURL itelf.. why do they even make libcurl?? Can't
everyone just use cURL from within the code itself??
