After `fpaste`_, I've managed to package `nautilus-pastebin`_ and
include it into the Fedora repositories. Nautilus-pastebin is an
extension to nautilus that enables you to paste a file to your favourite
online paste site. It has some presets and I've set the default to
`fpaste.org`_ for Fedora. It should come handy in the same way as
fpaste. Especially in areas of troubleshooting.

Thank you `Rahul`_ for pointing this app out to me. Thanks `Alessio
Treglia`_ for dealing with all my queries :)

I invite folks to please use the app and report bugs or RFEs to
bugzilla.
