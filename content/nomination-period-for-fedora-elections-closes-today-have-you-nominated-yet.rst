Attention all fedorians!

This is an urgent but gentle reminder that **the nomination period for
the elections ends today (November 13 at 2359 UTC)**. Please update the
wiki page with  your nominations before the nominations period ends
later today if you'd like to be considered and voted for! All the best!

- `Fedora Project Board`_ (two seats)
-  `FESCo (Engineering)`_ (four seats)
-  `FAmSCo (Ambassadors)`_ (three seats)

I'd also like to remind you that that the questionnaire will close today
as well:\ https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/F19_elections_questionnaire

Please regard this as critical:
- We currently have **ONE** nomination for FAmSCo (**to fill three
seats?**), **THREE** for FESCo (**to fill four seats?**) and
**\*NONE\*** for the Fedora Board **(to fill two seats!**).
- We have **no** questions in the questionnaire at all. :(
