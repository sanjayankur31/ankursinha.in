I was happy using GyachI for my Yahoo messenger needs. Ran outa luck.
People do not receive my messages when I use GyachI. Reinstalled,
removed config files, no difference, they still don't get my messages.

I've switched to Empathy for the time being. But, I miss the webcam
feature that GyachI provided, also the "**logged in as invisible**\ "
message that din't let people hide from you. :( Â (Is there an empathy
plugin for this one???)

If anyone else has the same problem, please comment. I might think of
submitting a bug if it's a common problem.
