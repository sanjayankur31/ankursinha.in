We had quite a good turnout for the first round of `Fedora classroom`_
sessions, so we're now trying to plan the second round. We need you to instruct
a session, and so, pass on the knowledge you've accrued over the years to
others in the community.  A lot of the folks that attend these sessions are
newbies who are still only testing the waters and haven't contributed yet, and
it makes it a lot easier for them to learn some skills from a contributor.

Please consider teaching a session. If you'd like to, please get in touch with
me on `#fedora-classroom on Freenode <https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#fedora-classroom>`__ or via e-mail at
my fedoraproject.org address. You can also contact the team on our `mailing
list <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/classroom@lists.fedoraproject.org/>`__.

Happy teaching!
