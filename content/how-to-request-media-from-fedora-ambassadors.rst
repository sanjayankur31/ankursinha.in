In the wake of a long thread on the Fedora India mailing list, I've
drafted a page that tries to explain the steps to be taken to request
Fedora Media from an Ambassador. This page hopes to encourage users to
use methods other than the free media programme (India is receiving 200
requests per month!). It also aims to provide a common work flow to
users and Ambassadors.
