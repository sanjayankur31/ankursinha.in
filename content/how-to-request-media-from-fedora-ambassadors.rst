In the wake of a long thread on the Fedora India mailing list, I've
drafted a page that tries to explain the steps to be taken to request
Fedora Media from an Ambassador. This page hopes to encourage users to
use methods other than the free-media programme (India is receiving 200
requests per month!). It also aims to provide a common work flow to
users and Ambassadors.
