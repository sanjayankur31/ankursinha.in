    Firstly, **Fedora just looks better**, despite being built around
    the same Gnome desktop as Debian. The astronomical theme that
    accompanies you while you launch the operating system is carried on
    to the blue desktop, and there's a d\ **istinct feeling that a lot
    of love has gone into Fedora's default theme.**

    Secondly, **Fedora manages to include OpenOffice.org 3**, while
    Debian is still a revision behind, and Fedora's version of Firefox
    keeps the original branding, rather than the confusing rebranding of
    all things Mozilla insisted on by the Debian developers.

    ***You will never take our freedom!***

    Both desktops take a hard line against including non-free open
    source software, and we greatly admire this stance. Both desktops
    prove that a purely open source desktop is just as functional as a
    hybrid desktop, even if you do have to make certain compromises.

    We feel that Debian's compromise of using the vaguely Adobe
    Flash-compatible Gnash, though admirable, confuses things slightly.
    It's difficult to tell when you go to YouTube, for instance, that
    the poor performance isn't a network problem rather than a Gnash
    problem.

    Fedora doesn't even try, but if you do want to install Adobe's
    Flash, you only need to download the RPM and click on this file
    once. A browser restart later, and you're ready for YouTube.

    You'll find packages split by category, and installation is easy,
    with the industry-standard RPM format handles dependencies without
    difficulty. As you would imagine from a distribution that's so
    closely related to Red Hat, updates and patches are taken very
    seriously.

    A feature we particularly like is that the update system will inform
    you about the nature of each update, whether it's a bugfix, a
    security update or a feature enhancement. The makes you more
    inclined to allow the updates to proceed, as well as keeping you on
    top of what is changing in your system.

    As with Red Hat Enterprise and Centos 5.2, **Fedora includes some
    bulletproof security packages**. It has a firewall enabled by
    default, and includes a sensible set of rules that you can enable or
    disable using a firewall configuration window. If you're
    particularly worried about security, SELinux can be enabled to lock
    down any wayward applications.

    **For every day desktop use, Fedora can't be beaten. The choice of
    software is excellent, and we can't think of anything that's
    missing. Fedora's stance on freedom is a little painful if you need
    proprietary drivers or MP3 support, but these issues can be worked
    around.**
    Both the Gnome and KDE desktops look and feel brilliant, and the
    performance of our Fedora installation is as good as any other tuned
    Linux distribution. It's also a distribution that will have users of
    other operating systems looking over your shoulder.

    **Fedora might not be the easiest distribution to use, or the one
    with the largest package repository, but we feel it represents the
    very best that open source software has to offer.**

Good article :)
