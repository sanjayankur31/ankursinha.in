This is probably common knowledge by now, but I thought I'd put it up
anyway.

`Fedmsg`_ is a great method that infra uses to get updates on what's
going on in Fedora. One can use the `gnome shell extension`_ to get a
set of updates from it. I don't use the extension though, since I'm
almost always on IRC. Here's how to do it on IRC:

1. Join the #fedora-fedmsg channel on Freenode
2. Configure your IRC client to highlight your FAS username. On
    **irssi**, this can be done using the **hilight** command:

``/hilight USERNAME``

You might need to save your config so this happens when you quit and
reuse irssi:

``/save``

That's it. Get updates. Here's an image of two messages on one of my
builds:

As an extra, you can use the `irssi-notify`_ to get notifications
whenever something is highlighted in **irssi**.

Have fun!
