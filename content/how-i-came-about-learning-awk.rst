Well, at current, I'm interning at the `IISc`_, as a research intern. A
large chunk of my work is analysing logs that this implementation spews
out and providing it to the team. These analysis reports enable us to
look at trends, false positives and the such. Since the logs are 40,000
lines of stuff that's difficult to make sense out of, I used bash shell
scripting with awk to extract data from it, and sort it etc. Awk is
great! I'm no expert yet, but given the time, I'll go ahead and practice
it some more. If you'd like to jump into awk, start `here`_
