To fellow **Facebook** users :

I just got two of these from folks who deny sending them.. Looks like FB
is in for some fun :) Lukily, i had just read the notification in
Evolution and hadn't clicked the link when my room mate went, " waht??
Why the F would I send you a message on FB!!! ".... Dunno how its
spreading though.. Looks like the site gains access to your FB account..
Some of you webfolks got an idea?

Needless to say.. Try the addresses given at your own risk..

Another site that I got this from is "**linketria DOT be**\ "

    Suyash sent you a message.

    Subject: Hi

    "Visit **redfriend dot be**"
