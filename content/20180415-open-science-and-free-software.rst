:summary: It is becoming increasingly clear that the openness of Science is a
          necessity. Using `Free software`_ can help.


Recently, a number of neuroscientists came together to sign a `letter
<http://opensourceforneuroscience.org/>`__ that commits to the use of `Open
source`_ software for their research. The initiative has been described in a
`research paper here
<http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30981-9>`__.  This is one of
the many steps scientists are taking to improve the current scientific
ecosystem. This includes the gathering of data, its analysis, its sharing
between research groups, the review of gained results, and of course, the
dissemination of these results. It has become clear that just doing the
science is not sufficient. It must be done in a way that enables further
research, and informed, evidence based policy making.

Climate change, and the scepticism that still surrounds it is a great example
of how there's more to be done to spread the scientific evidence to the public,
to ensure that policy is made on the basis of evidence.  Indeed, `people are
marching for science, constantly <https://www.marchforscience.com/>`__,
reminding us that "It’s time we held our political leaders accountable for
supporting good science policy. It’s time we join together and demand that our
leaders use science to inform their work and cast their votes for science."
`Here's a documentary <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00y4yql>`__ that I
think did a good job at explaining things. (If you're not in the UK, it may not
be available to you there, but it's also available here on `YouTube
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGUJ1vla5BE>`__).

Similarly, the scientific publishing process has also been under the
microscope. The argument is that researchers do the work, they write the
papers, other researchers review the work, and yet, researchers must pay (quite
a bit!) to read the work. Unless one is at an academic establishment that has
subscriptions to these publishing companies, one cannot read the science.

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nature and other Springer journals make all of their money from free labor provided by scientists, who write all the papers and do all of the peer review. And now they are cashing in: &quot;Springer Nature aims to raise 1.2 billion euros in new money in IPO&quot; <a href="https://t.co/fKSOdMbxmo">https://t.co/fKSOdMbxmo</a></p>&mdash; Steven Salzberg (@StevenSalzberg1) <a href="https://twitter.com/StevenSalzberg1/status/985280814421368837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 14, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The `Open Access movement
<https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-access>`__ was born to remedy this
situation, but there are other bits of the publishing pipeline that must still
be improved. `Predatory publishers <https://beallslist.weebly.com/>`__, the
over-dependence on `impact factor
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor>`_, are two examples of commonly
discussed subjects amongst scientists.

In short, the lack of openness hampers scientific research:

- Proprietary tools are inaccessible to researchers that may not have the
  necessary funding.
- Proprietary tools also do not permit one to check them for correctness, since
  the source code is not available.
- Use of proprietary formats to store data makes the data inaccessible to
  anyone that does not have access to the tools.
- Data that is not shared makes it impossible to reproduce results, to verify
  them, to build on them.
- Publishing in journals that are not freely readable makes the science, the
  results, inaccessible to most of the public.

The list is not complete, but it gives you an idea of what is at stake here.

Now, note that paying for these tools may not be an issue for for universities
in developed countries that receive sufficient funding. But one must remember,
that science is not limited to developed countries, and must not be limited to
universities that receive large funding, right? It must be accessible to everyone.


Here's where I cannot help feeling that the `Free software philosophy`_ fits in
rather well with science.

Not only must the scientific method be open, the whole pipeline from data storage, to analysis, to dissemination must be more open to improve the public uptake and policy making needs to be open. The `Free software philosophy`_ is all about openness, so it is only natural that I think `Free software`_ could solve some of these issues.


I've created a list of scientists that I follow on Twitter `here
<https://twitter.com/sanjay_ankur/lists/research>`__. It's not complete, and I
keep adding more folks to it as I run into them. Feel free to use the list too.
