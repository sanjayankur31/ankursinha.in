I've made a small survey I request everyone to fill up. It has 3
questions, of which one asks your name :P

It is intended to collect data on what people have been doing and what
difficulties they're facing while carrying out ambassador activities.
Once we have the data, we will have a better chance of finding efficient
solutions to these issues.

The survey:

Please do fill it up! Thanks!
