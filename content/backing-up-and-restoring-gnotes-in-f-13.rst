I'm just putting this out here. I think most are already aware of this.

One can back his\ **~/.gnote** directory up and restore it when
required. In Fedora 13, the default directory has been changed to
**~/.local/share/gnote**

It's mentioned in the release notes draft `here`_

Copy your files to the new location and restart Gnote, you're good to
go.
