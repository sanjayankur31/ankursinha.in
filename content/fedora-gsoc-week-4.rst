Hello and welcome to the weekly news! I, FranciscoD, shall share with
you the happenings in this week related to the on going `Fedora
Medical`_ initiative under the GSoC programme. This special broadcast,
is in place of the weekly one that airs Sunday night.

This week, I've been trying to package the `FreeMedForms`_ applications.
Most of them are still at Alpha, and only a few are stable. FreeDiams is
stable, and has been submitted for `review`_. The FreeMedForms spec is
under construction, and should be up for review today (Sunday!).

The dcm4che suite is still held up, as the `previous post`_ had
detailed. I'm going to ping upstream again (I think I've pinged someone
related to the project already, but I need to double check. ) and hope
we can get the sources to the test-images to complete the packaging.

This coming week,  I'll submit \ `Ginki CADx`_ for review to start with.
Once I'm done with that, I'll move to `OpenEMR`_. There's a \*long\*
list `here`_.

We do need more reviewers. So if you've gotten some time to spare,
please do look at the `fedora medical tracker bug`_, and pick up a
review ticket.
