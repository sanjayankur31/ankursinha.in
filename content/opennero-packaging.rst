OpenNero!
=========

A game platform for Artificial Intelligence research and education
------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been taking Stanford's online `Artificial Intelligence`_ and
`Machine Learning`_ classes of late. There's a competition to do with
`OpenNero`_ coming up. It would be awesome to have in the Fedora
repositories. If anyone's interested in helping me package this, and
it's build requires, please drop me a mail at `ankursinha AT
fedoraproject DOT org`_. Thanks!
