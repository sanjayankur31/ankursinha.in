It's a general statement.

I'm a much newer contributor to Fedora than most people I know. I only
began contributing to Fedora after Fedora 8 was released (when I signed
up as a font package maintainer ). I had never been part of such a huge
voluntary community that does excellent work before then (I turned 22
this year ).

Over the years, the number of mailing lists I try to follow has grown
quite a bit. Now I have about 25 folders in my Evolution client
dedicated to different Fedora mailing lists. I don't go through all the
mails, but pick and choose what threads seem like stuff I'd need to
know. 25 mailing lists means a lot of discussion, a lot of people, a lot
of points of view and a lot of different moods/tones in which people
respond to queries/mails. This post is about the last one.

Fedora has a guideline which goes "be excellent to each other". I've had
to remind folks of this at multiple occasions now. It's not a random
guideline, it has reason behind it. I'll enumerate a few:

#. The mailing list has not been set up so you can vent out a bad day.
#. If you need someone's help, being rude to him/her is really not going
   to get you much in return.
#. It's contagious! Once a rude discussion begins, more and more people
   leave constructive work to jump in with their points of view!
#. It gets nothing done. Ultimately, the thread ends with someone going,
   "let's calm it down a bit, mate". The actual purpose of the thread is
   forgotten because so much discussion over tones took place.
#. It makes people who actually want to work ignore the thread. Even
   less chances of any work being done.
#. When team mates, community members bicker amongst themselves, the
   entire community gets laughed at. You might not care, but some of us
   do.

What you should be doing when you reply to a mail:

#. Understand what the thread is about. Replying without anything
   constructive is a waste of resources. Longer threads get less work
   done.
#. If you're angry, go take a walk. Calm down. Think it through. Even if
   someone's been rude to you, a stern reply won't change anything. In
   fact, you'll end up privately mailing each other, wasting each
   other's valuable time.
#. Learn to ignore personal comments. All of us are mature enough to
   filter out the personal remarks and harsh tones and only pick up the
   important portions of an email. If an email is only personal remarks
   and tones, delete it.
#. Re-read your email twice before you send it. Is it too aggressive? Is
   it just too much useless talk? Is there an unnecessary personal
   comment?

The bottom line here is that decorum should be maintained over a mailing
list. We are all friends, but tones and feelings need other channels of
exchange, a mailing list is not one.
