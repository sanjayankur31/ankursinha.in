The `Fedora India community <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/India>`__ has always been quite an active group of people working in various Fedora teams and Special Interest Groups (SIGs).
At some point in recent years, people got busy with projects as we tend to do, and we stopped having regular community meetings.
This is unfortunate, since these meetings keep the community ticking, and provide a platform for new members to join in.

Recently, there's been interest in revitalising the Fedora India community.
We've started to clean up the mailing list, and we'd like to restart regular meetings.
We had a short first one at the end of 2020 to kick things off.
You can read the logs `here <https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/teams/fedora-india/fedora-india.2020-12-11-10.01.html>`__.

The next meeting, the first of 2021, will happen soon.
In the meantime, this is a short notice to make the community aware of these on-goings.
Please subscribe to the `mailing list <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/india.lists.fedoraproject.org/>`__ to keep up with the community's activities.
If it has been a while since you were active there, please feel free to send in a short introduction so newcomers can get to know you.

The usual chat channels are also active.
You can join #fedora-india on the Freenode IRC network `here <https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#fedora-neuro>`__.
It is also bridged to the `@fedoraindia Telegram super group <https://t.me/fedoraindia>`__.

We hope to see you in the channels!
