A quick update (My internet subscription at home lapsed and I'm posting
from office!)

This week was pretty constructive. I'm still working with Orion on
fixing the `DCMTK.cmake file`_. I need ITK to test Ginkgo-CADx but it's
breaking in mock. Mario appears to be on vacation (where are you
Mario!?) and I'm going to have to wait until he returns to get back on
this.

`XMedcon`_ is progressing well. The last two build dependencies are in
review. Richard's taken them up. They should be approved any time now.

I've checked out the latest revision of `freemat`_ which hopefully
contains some fixes. I'll post the updated srpm today to tomorrow.

`GoFigure2`_ upstream has been incredibly responsive. They've been
making frequent releases with fixes as the review progresses (which is
awesome!)
