Thought I'd read up some `QC`_ (I don't feel like working at the
moment).

In `this`_ comic strip he says:

    Before you send me angry, tear-stained e(mo)mails, let me just say
    that you are perfectly entitled to enjoy listening to any of the
    bands that Marten and Faye are wishing to assault in today's strip.
    I would never begrudge someone their taste in music. It's such a
    subjective thing that there really is no "right" or "wrong" when it
    comes to one's listening habits.

    The flipside of that coin, though, is that I AM perfectly entitled
    to make fun of emo bands for being Goddamned crybabies who take
    themselves too seriously. ;)

+1 to that!
