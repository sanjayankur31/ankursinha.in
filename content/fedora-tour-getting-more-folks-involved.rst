So, there's a `FAD planned at Pune`_ towards the end of May. If you look
at the agenda for the event, there are some folks who'd like to
contribute to the Tour. Since there are only a couple of us working on
it as of now, we decided that more hands on deck would be great for the
project. Why wait till May? Lets get started straight away! I've planned
a small "beginners session" to get the interested parties up to speed
with the project. `Here's the announcement`_ on the india mailing list.
We intend a global announcement too. I quickly planned this up so we can
get some REAL work done at the FAD.

The session is planned at 2200 IST on Wednesday, the 14th of April.
Everyone interested is welcome to join us @#fedora-tour on Freenode.
