The `nominees`_ have all marked their preferences on whenisgood. At the
moment, only the `FESCo nominees`_ have managed to find a slot that
suits them all.

The FESCo townhall will be held on `June 10, 2013 at 1700 GMT`_. The irc
channels in use will be `#fedora-townhall`_ and
`#fedora-townhall-public`_ on Freenode. Please mark your calendars
(`fedora calendar link`_). I hope to see you there!

I'll post information about the other two town halls as soon as I manage
to find a slot that everyone's happy with.

More information on the wiki page `here`_.
