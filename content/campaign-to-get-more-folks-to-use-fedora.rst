So, two of us, Ambassadors here at Manipal are starting a sort of a
campaign to increase the number of students using Fedora in college.

This is the first part of the campaign: The poster ;)

I'll keep the blog updated with the other steps that we take. If there
are any changes needed in the poster (as per guidelines etc that I could
have missed), please comment or email me at "ankursinha AT fedoraproject
DOT org" . I still have 4-5 days to put these up.
