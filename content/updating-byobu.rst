`Byobu`_ in fedora hasn't been updated in a while. The current fedora
version is **4.4**, while upstream has moved on to **5.17**. That's
quite a lag we have. There's a `bug filed requesting an update`_ by
`Upstream release monitoring`_, but it hasn't received any human
responses at all! It was filed in October 2011. Since I use byobu, 24x7,
I've gone ahead and taken the initiative to update the package and
submit the `spec`_\ to the maintainer in the bug. I hope to see it
updated soon. I've done a `scratch build`_, you can use the noarch
package if you are in a hurry like me. The srpm is available `here`_, so
you can build it for your fedora version too.

I'm not well versed with byobu internals really, so if you do find any
issues with the updated package, please comment on the bug and let the
maintainer know.Â
