I finally got down to work.

*1st order of the day -> rename loki.*

My first search gave me the answer. **Loki will now be
called**\ `**Hleahtor**`_. "Hleahtor" is a synonym for "laughter". It's
archaic English and isn't used a lot any more. I am a hundred percent
sure there isn't a software by this name anywhere ;)

I'm going to do some quick fixes before I put up a new release with the
new name (It doesn't make sense to make a release ONLY for the
renaming). I've received some recommendations/advice/feedback from
folks. Now that I've gotten more time on my hands, I'll get down to
working on loki/hleahtor again.

Thanks all who took the time to comment/try out the app. Cheers!
