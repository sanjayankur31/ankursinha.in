I had `earlier posted on keeping your notes in sync with your android
phone`_. This involved an ftp client and a tiny shell script. I've run
into `Snowy`_ recently, and I think it would be great to have an
instance on fedora infra for the community. If you haven't already,
`this post`_ tells you how you can use Gnote to organize your life a
little bit. It works really well for me, so I really suggest you try it
out.

I haven't had the chance to try Snowy out yet. It's still at beta, and
the `instance gnome is running`_\ is by invitation only. I'm going to
try playing around with it a bit. If you're interested in helping me get
this running on fedora infra, do mail me at **ankursinha AT
fedoraproject DOT org**.

This could also help upstream fix bugs, and maybe we could write them a
few patches too! It's all `Python-Django`_ by the way :)

`Tomdroid`_ just hit 0.5. It's still pretty beta, and is read only. It's
moving along well really, and I'm more than happy to just have my notes
on my phone to keep a tab on what I need to do and what I've done
already. A public snowy instance would help to alleviate the pain that
Tomdroid release's read only nature may cause.
