A `fedora-medical`_ IRC meeting will be held in #fedora-meeting/-1/-2
later today. Please join us if you're interested in the SIG. The meeting
will discuss the current state and what we must do to quickly get an
unofficial spin out to collect feedback. This is my mail to the SIG with
a rough draft of the agenda:

`` 1. Currently packaged software 2. Pending software 2a. Software in the review list 2b. Software not yet packaged at all 3. Software to be included in the Fedora Medical Spin 3a. Details like what desktop should it be based on (default package set) 3b. Do we have some folks who can work on making an unofficial spin for the time being? (until we make it an official spin) 4. Do we have any users we can give this media out too for feedback? 5. Do we need to maintain documentation on how this software is to be used? Fedora docs? Wiki pages? 6. Who's working on what? 7. Any new folks who'd like to join in and help out!``

The meeting is at **12 noon UTC**. Please check your local time `here`_.
