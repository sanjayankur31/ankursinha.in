:summary: An introduction to computational neuroscience.

People usually seem to know what neuroscience is and what neuroscientists do - study the nervous system, of which the brain is a part. In fact, the moment I reveal to someone that I'm working towards becoming a neuroscientist, I can immediately tell that I'm being pictured as a lab-coated figure perched on a stool in a laboratory in a basement somewhere with only test tubes and chemicals for company, probably bent over a microscope looking at something slimy. It is at this point that I usually step in to explain that I work in *computational* neuroscience and neither own a lab coat nor work with brain slices. This clarification usually results in some disappointment. Yea. I know. I'd love to drill into people's skulls too but we don't always get what we want, do we? Anyway, in the end I'm left looking at a visage betraying puzzlement implying the question, "er, so what exactly do you do?"

This seems to happen quite often. Often enough to make me realise that computational neuroscience is not well known enough. This post is my attempt at an explanation, and the first in my series on computational neuroscience. 

PS: While I'll try to give references to scientific articles wherever I can readily find them, this may not always be possible. After all, this is only a blog post :)

The brain - a quick overview
=============================

The brain, obviously, is a very complex organ. It is who we are. Every sensation that we experience, every emotion, every memory, even our sense of self is a product of whatever is happening in our brains.

In a few numbers, the brain is thought to consist of around **120 billion** specialised cells (**neurons**) [1]_. While neurons seem to carry out most of the information processing, there are other cells that do other things, Glial cells, for example. Neurons don't function in isolation from each other, either. They "speak" to each other via **synapses**, with each neuron forming about **7000** synapses. This makes the total number of connections between neurons in the brain in the region of a **quadrillion**. Of course, there's a lot going on in the brain. It isn't surprising, therefore, that while the brain is only about **2%** of the total body weight, it uses **20%** of the Oxygen that we breathe [2]_.

The regions of the brain have been classified in different ways. The lobes, for example, are an anatomical classification [3]_. The Broadmann areas are a functional classification [4]_ and so on. There's just too much information here to summarise in a blog post. The Wikipedia pages should give you a good idea of the overall picture. If you're looking for a better academic resource, Kandel's Principles of Neural Science is an excellent book [5]_.
