`0ad is an awesome awesome awesome game`_! For anyone who's played an
Age of empires style game, you absolutely must try 0ad!

On Fedora, run:

``sudo yum install 0ad #and start playing!``

Game development isn't easy, and 0ad is requesting donations. I just
donated the little that I could.\ `If you have a little to spare, please
donate and make this awesome game better!`_
