:summary: A mailer envelop for the Fedora free-media programme.

A `mailer`_ exists for the free-media program. `Joe`_ had made this
sometime back (Thanks a ton Joe!). I had recently posted to the Free
Media list requesting a more "generic" mailer that everyone could use,
something not region specific. `Since I got my tablet working`_, I
thought I'd give it a try. A few hours of hacking around on Inkscape and
here's what I've gotten. It's plain (very very plain), the interior is
almost empty (Can you folks tell me how to populate the interior??) All
the SVG sources can be found `here`_ at my fedorapeople space. Comments
welcome.
