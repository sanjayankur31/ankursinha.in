From Jack's message on the mailing list :

    Continuing on in our series of Fedora 11 podcasts, we present an
    interview of the series with Tom 'Spot' Callaway. In case you don't
    know Spot, he's been making Fedora happen since before Fedora was
    called Fedora. Spot is a Red Hat Engineer, the Fedora Engineering
    Manager, and of course an active and knowledgeable community member.
    With keen insights and an eagle-eye view of the Fedora release
    process,
    the community, and our history and roadmap, you can be sure that
    any chat with Spot is worth your while.

    [http://jack.fedorapeople.org/Fedora%2011%20Overview%20-%20Spot%20Callaway.ogg\ ]
    In the interview, Spot covers much ground, with everything from
    features in the upcoming release such as 20 Second Startup
    [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/20SecondStartup\ ] and
    Kernel Mode Setting
    [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/KernelModesetting\ ] to the
    future Fedora artists movement. Spot also talks about the importance
    and benefit of Fedora's upstream oriented developer process, the
    recent enhancements to Fedora's QA process, and the addition of
    members to the Fedora QA team. Finally Spot takes a nostalgic trip
    down Memory Lane, with a discussion of the long history behind
    Fedora, what he thinks Fedora as a community has to offer
    contributors, and why Fedora is the very best place to be.
