Today is Day 1 of my 2 month internship at the IISc.

I'm at the department of Computer Science and Automation and the place
is awesome! The corridors are filled with labs. They have white boards
citing quotes from scientists and contributors. I came across quotes
from Stroustrup, CAR Hoare and others .  They have charts with things
about great people all over the department. Once of them had Djikstra,
Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds to name a few on it. ALL the labs
have charts at their entrances with info about the subject and great
people associated with them.

People all over the place are working on things in the labs, discussing
stuff I got no clues about.

This is the coolest place I've been in a looong time! I am happy! I
dunno how to explain to you folks how I feel, but it's brilliant!

BTW, I decided to wear my Fedora-India polo to day 1 ;)
