    **PackageKit in Fedora 11.**

    In Fedora 11, we have a number of features that are the result of a
    planned process of maturation. We often put new features into the
    distribution with the purpose of garnering more information on how
    people put a technology to work. Then that information can be
    digested by developers to help them design and refine their
    software. Itâ€™s a cultivation mentality: By focusing more attention
    on advanced technologies, we help them mature and improve faster.
    Including them in a popular, high-volume distribution whose mission
    is to advanced free and open source software is a natural strategic
    fit.........

The podcast is present on the page of the post or you can get it here
