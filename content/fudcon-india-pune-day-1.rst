It's been amazing! I've

-  met loadsa people, jsmith, azneita, jsimon, and a lot of my fedora
   india colleagues
-  GPG signing party
-  attended many talks!
-  took many photo
-  worked on my sessions for tomorrow
-  even did a package review!
-  tweeted about all of it
-  ate great food!

It may come down to a few bullet points, but trust me, it's been
entertaining, fun and tiring!! I'm attending a lightening talk right
now, Jared is talking about the new upcoming Fedora 16 release at the
moment! Cya!

I'll be uploading a lot of pictures and more details as the event
continues!
