I `recently posted`_ that I'd be out for a week with a fried
motherboard. It just got worse. It's beyond repair and the only thing to
do is to get myself a new laptop. Since I have end semester exams from
next week, I'm going to be too busy to run around looking for a new
laptop. Sadly, therefore, I'm going to be off Fedora community work
until the second week of December (when I get home). If there's anything
urgent that you need me to look into, such as my `packages`_, please
email me. I'll try to do what I can. Thanks.
