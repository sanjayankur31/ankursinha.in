I personally like Gnome3 quite a bit. It works really well for me.
That's a story for another day, however.

I've been looking for ways to integrate `mpd (Media Player Daemon)`_
better with gnome-shell to improve my GUI experience. I use `ncmpcpp`_
in my terminal instance, but it's always nice to have multimedia keys
working and notifications too. Until now, I used to use indimpc (`a
Fedora review ticket that I filed is here`_). Tonight, I ran into the
`gnome-shell-mediaplayer-indicator extension`_. It supports quite a few
music applications via the `MPRIS2`_ specification. However, before you
can use this with mpd, you need to install the `mpDris2`_ package. It
isn't in the Fedora repositories, so I've filed a `review ticket`_
(**Package maintainer? Please review it!**). There's also an `rpm for
Fedora 18`_ that I've built and am currently using.
