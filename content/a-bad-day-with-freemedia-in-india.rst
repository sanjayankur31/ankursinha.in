The quotes will say it all:

    Dear Mr.ankur,

    Will I ever recieve this media?

    Regards,

My reply:

    Dear Mr abc,

    While I agree that it's taking longer than usual to get media to
    you, I do not appreciate you pretending as if you have the right to
    any media that free-media sends out. If you were ready to take some,
    ANY trouble whatsoever, you could have gone ahead and collected
    media from an Ambassador right away! Instead, you prefer to sit at
    home and get media delivered to you, FREE of cost, without putting
    in any effort other than moving your fingers on a key board: how
    convenient. You are in Bangalore, as per my earlier comment, we have
    numerous ambassadors in Koramangla. Even if you are new to
    Bangalore, finding out what bus to take to reach Koramangala on a
    weekend is really not a lot to ask. It's been a month, right? Still
    new to Bangalore?

    There are two categories of people who request media from us. One,
    who understand that we volunteers are taking out time from our busy
    lives, and spending our money to get media across to you. Such
    people are very patient and profusely grateful: One of them even
    sent me a money order with the postal and media charge. It was the
    least he could do for getting media sitting at home, he said.

    The other category, is one that thinks we are a government service
    running by tax payers money. They think they have the right to have
    media delivered at their door step, without moving an inch, without
    paying a paisa. We are not, make no mistake. We are doing this out
    of goodwill, and our love for Fedora. We are not doing it to feed
    ingrates.

    I'm sorry. I'm not going to send out media to you. Please file a
    fresh ticket next month and wait for someone to accept it, or
    purchase from one of the many online vendors.

    No further emails from you will be entertained, Sir. The ticket is
    closed, so is the matter.

This person filed a ticket last month. I ran out of x86\_64 media so I
replied saying I'll send him media with the March batch. I haven't
gotten down to sending it out yet.

He is in Bangalore, where almost 5 of us Ambassadors are. He has an
Ambassador who is two bus rides away! "But why take the trouble? It
should come at my doorstep, I have the right!" What right Sir?! I really
fail to understand this! WHAT right!?!

A majority of requesters are not even polite enough to inform us that
the media was deliverd. A minority emails, thanking us. This person is a
whole new level. One that I could not ignore.
