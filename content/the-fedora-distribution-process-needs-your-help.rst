Hello!! Do you send out fedora media to people? Do you distribute fedora
to your classmates and colleagues? Do you hold and attend events to help
distribute fedora to more and more people? Most of us do, and are
therefore a part of the Fedora Distribution Team. The Distribution team
isn't exactly an entity like the Marketing or Design teams. At least not
any more. It was meant to co-ordinate the distribution process to make
it a better and easier experience for both users and us volunteers.
We've been working on this for a while now. The most recent step was to
mail the Ambassadors' list
(http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/ambassadors/2010-November/015966.html)
requesting feedback. That complete, as the next step, I request
\*everyone\* in the Fedora community to please have a read Â of the
draft. If you think there's something that can be done better, please
comment and let us know. You can comment here, or on the "discussion"
page on the wiki itself. The draft is `here`_. Thanks a bunch!
