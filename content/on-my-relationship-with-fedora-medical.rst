**Of late, I've had to deal with the fact that people believe that the
driving force behind me applying for the fedora medical GSoC last year
was only money. I address the matter in this post.**

Susmit had initiated the `fedora medical SIG`_ in an attempt to make a
fedora based spin that would be packed with software related to health
care.

Last year, at the time of the GSoC, Mario and Susmit put up fedora
medical as one of the prospective projects for the Fedora GSoC. Here's
the entry from the `wiki page`_:

    Fedora Medical

    Status: In progress.

    Summary of idea: Here, we are looking for a couple students who have
    some experience in RPM packaging, python, and bash. This would be a
    good opportunity to learn in depth packaging and fedora contributor
    ecosystem.

    This is a work in progress and details can be found here:
    http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/FedoraMedical

    We are looking forward to do mainly packaging and getting them
    published to fedora repo. However, we will also be doing some
    tooling and associated works. So, python and bash will be required.

    Understanding fedora package maintainer guideline is required.
    Having existing packages in fedora will be a plus. Also, the student
    should be interested in maintaining some of those packages after
    SOC.

    Contacts: Susmit Shannigrahi

    Mentor(s): Susmit and Mario Ceresa

    Notes:

As you'll see, the requirements were to be adept at RPM packaging. This
happens to be one of my areas of contribution in Fedora, and I'm pretty
good at it. You'll notice it also mentions that:

    "the student should be interested in maintaining some of those
    packages after SOC."

The intention, as I understand it, was for the student to hang on to the
packages until the SIG expanded and volunteers who actually used the
software could take over. A student may or may not have healthcare as
his subjects, and cannot be expected to maintain all the packages single
handed. The main purpose of the above GSoC idea was:

    "We are looking forward to do mainly packaging and getting them
    published to fedora repo."

Packaging was right up my alley, I applied. Since I was already a
package maintainer with almost 4 years of packaging experience, and an
undergraduate student, I fit the bill pretty well and was accepted. I
worked on the packages throughout the GSoC period with weekly blog
updates. You can find all my GSoC related blog entries for the entire 4
months in the archives: `May 2011`_, `June`_, `July`_ and `August`_. The
`final report is here`_.

Once the SoC was over, I tried to complete my pending reviews, and
looked for people who could take over the packages in the long term.
Here's my `request to the devel list`_. As `John suggested`_, I didn't
orphan them, to save the new maintainers the trouble of getting them
re-reviewed. *I'm still carrying them.*

So my incentive was only money then? Why? Because I didn't take it upon
myself to keep the SIG alive? How/Why is that on my shoulders? Why does
a failed/in hiatus fedora medical SIG imply that **my** GSoC term was a
failure? I beg to disagree. I accept that the fedora medical SIG is
inactive due to whatever reasons. But, I did my part: I completed my
packages, my review swaps, my progress updates. My part was never to
take over the SIG and lead it. My part was never to lobby for new
recruits. *Even then, I did try*. The inactivity of the SIG means that
the *work I did on all those packages is going waste*, in case it isn't
apparent. I got paid for my work, as per the terms of GSoC. If the SIG
has now gone on hiatus, should I return the money I got for my work?

The driving force was fedora-medical needing someone to package their
software up quickly so they could proceed with their spin release. I was
paid for successfully carrying out the required task. For those who
aren't aware, the GSoC has two appraisal periods where mentors (in my
case Mario and Susmit) grade the students' work. I passed both of these,
only after which I was paid.

I resent the idea that's been floating: my contribution was only driven
by money. This is not in line with "being excellent to each other".

I've read and re-read, revised and re-revised this post to get rid of
anything that might offend anyone. I've taken no names, pointed no
fingers. Please do not deduce anything of the sort from the post. I only
want the air around me cleared up.
