I was looking to well, "beautify" my system a little. I get these urges
from time to time, yes. I found one that was in the `Fedora fonts
packaging wish list`_ called "`Anka Coder Fonts`_\ ". They do look
really good. I prefer them to the default Gnome3 monospace font. I
installed them using the Gnome font viewer tool and selected them using
gnome tweak tool. I've `packaged them up though`_, and you can use the
RPMs if you like. `RPMs for Fedora 18 and Fedora 20 are available`_. It
shouldn't be much of a problem to generate RPMs for any Fedora release
though.

Here's a screen-shot with some code, and email in monospace. The font in
use is the Anka Coder Condensed font, which, as the `font home page`_
describes is better suited to daily use.

**PS: There are quite a few more fonts on the wish-list. Package them up
if you have the time? Oh! Review swaps for this package are more than
welcome!**
