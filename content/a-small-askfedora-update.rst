Status update
-------------

For any one who doesn't already know, `Ask Fedora`_ is our community
based troubleshooting that's an `askbot`_ instance. Along with `#fedora
on Freenode`_ and `fedoraforum.org`_, Ask Fedora is one of the channels
where users can get help from us.

We've been working on improving Ask Fedora from infrastructure wise.
Recently, we changed the mail back end to use `django-post-office`_ to
speed it up a bit. A lot of other improvements are in the pipe line too.
We'll push them out as we find more cycles to implement them. The
`staging instance`_ has a great theme which I'm looking to apply to the
production instance sometime soon.

Call for more participation: 15 minutes a day!
----------------------------------------------

At the moment, Ask has a lot more users that aren't Fedora people,
generally folks new to Fedora, our **end users**. There **aren't enough
community folks** answering the many many questions that end users ask.
In the absence of community participants, end users ask and answer each
others questions. Since they're not as aware of the workings of the
community, the changes in each release, even bugs that are already
filed, their answers are very very general. These answers don't have
links referenced, they are sometimes inaccurate. All in all, they're not
at the standard I'd personally like them to be. Ask Fedora is one of the
simplest channels where end users get in touch with the community. It's
pretty important that we have a **good database of questions and a high
standard of answers**. It's even more important that we ensure that the
answers there are correct. With this in mind, I request all of you, to
spend **fifteen minutes a day** answering questions at Ask Fedora.
That's more than enough, specially if a majority of us do it.

If you have any suggestions, `please open a ticket at the infra trac
instance against the "Ask" component.`_
