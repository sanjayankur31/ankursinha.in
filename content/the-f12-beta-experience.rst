Just got my system upto F 12 today (11.92 actually).

Everything works. The installer played bug free, nouveau is looking good
(do i need kmod-nvidia anymore?)

The new network manager interface looks awesome. I noticed some
improvement in bluetooth too. Anyway, it's just been half a day. More
features to praise and more bugs to swat as we go on!!

With just a few days left for the final release, I'm sure this one's
going to be an even bigger leap than Leonidas. Go Constantine!!
