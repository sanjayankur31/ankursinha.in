This week was slow from the GSoC perspective. My tasks were to
reorganize the wiki and to begin helping out with reviews. I'm working
on helping out with the `vxl review request`_ at the time and will
probably have something on it by tomorrow night. The wiki will also be
up to date in the next few days. With the GSoC work period officially
beginning in two weeks time, I hope to hit top speed!
