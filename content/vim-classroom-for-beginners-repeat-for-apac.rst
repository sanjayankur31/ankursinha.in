Hi there!

| As promised, I'm going to repeat the **VIM class for beginners**
tomorrow at
|  **2100 IST (1530 UTC)** to suit APAC. I'm going to cover more or less
the
|  same points I covered in the initial class. Please try and make it :)

**The venue of course, is #fedora-classroom on Freenode.**
