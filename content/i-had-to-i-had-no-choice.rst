I really had no choice. I really wanted to stick to nouveau for my
nvidia card, but it was holding up on development of the fedora-tour
(see my numerous posts regarding the bug and segmentation faults). I
finally gave in and switched to kmod-nvidia from RPMFusion. No
segmentation fault now, time to get back to work. My system is now less
free than it used to be.
