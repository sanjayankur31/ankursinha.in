I'm due to join university to start my masters course later this month.
I'm currently busy readying everything to move to Sydney, and will be
busy with orientation and getting settled once I get there. I will
therefore be unavailable till the end of July. Please e-mail me at my
fedoraproject id if something urgent comes up. I should be back in early
August :)
