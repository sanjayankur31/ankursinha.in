It always is! *Always*! **ALWAYS!** ***ALWAYS!***

It doesn't really matter how old you are. It doesn't really matter what
you studied at school or what you majored in. If you're looking to learn
a lot of new cool stuff, and meet amazing (knowledgeble and fun!) people
in the process, `just sign up`_.

|s1|

*Where should you start? Who should you talk to? Should you take up this
task, or that one, or that one? Should this be done like this?* There's
a plethora of questions newbies run into.

|s2|

Sometime back, some of us got together and started the `Fedora Join
SIG`_ to help anyone who'd want to join the Fedora community hop on to
the bus. Being a newbie can be frightening. The Join SIG is a channel
where experienced contributors can help newbies get through this phase.
We've set up a `mailing list`_ and an `IRC chat channel`_.

|s3|

If you're a contributor, join the SIG and help us help prospective
contributors. If you're looking to join Fedora, come talk to us!

`Nitesh`_ did an awesome job with the artwork for us! Thanks a bunch
Nitesh!
